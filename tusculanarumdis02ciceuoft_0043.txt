INTRODUCTION xxxvii

χρόνῳ μαλάττεται τὰ πάθη κᾶν αἱ δόξαι μένωσι τοῦ κακόν τι αῧτοῖς γεγονέναι
καὶ ὃ Χρύσιππος ἐν τῷ δευτέρῳ περὶ παθῶν μαρτυρεῖ γράφων ὧδε · (ζητήσαι δὲ
ἅν τις καὶ περὶ τῆς οἶνέσεως τῆς λύπης πῶς γίνεται πότερον δόξης τινος μετα-
κινουμένης ἢ πασῶν διαμενουσῶν καὶ διὰ τί τοῦτο ἔσται.’ εἶτα ἐπιφέρων φησί
(δοκεῖ δέ μοι ἦ μὲν τοιαύτη δόξα διαμένειν ὅτι κακὸν αὐτό, ὃ δή πάρεστιν, ε’γ-
χρονιζομένης δέ οἷνίεσθαι ἦ συστολὴ καὶ, ὦς οἶμαι, ἧ ἐπὶ τήν συστολὴν ὁρμή·
τυχὸν δὲ καὶ ταύτης διαμενούσης οὐχ ὑπακούσεται τὰ ἑξῆς διὰ ποιὰν α”λλην
ἐπιγενομένην διάθεσιν ἀσυλλόγιστον τούτων γινομένων κτλ] It is clear from
this passage that Chrysippus acknowledged the psychological fact that
emotion becomes less vehement by the mere lapse of time, though he
seems to have found this fact somewhat difficult to reconcile with his
view that emotion was a δόξα upon which time in itself could not have
any effect. Posidonius seized upon his difficulty and in a forcible
passage (op. cit. p. 399 M. [p. 424 K.]) developed the view that the
gradual cessation of the emotions was to be attributed to the satisfaction
or exhaustion of the irrational elements of the soul. Of this difficulty
and controversy there is not the slightest hint in Cicero, another proof
that he cannot have drawn in this book upon a work of Posidonius.

But Chrysippus, while admitting a certain element of uncertainty in
the psychological details, was sure that in some cases the value of time
in these matters lay in the opportunity for reflexion which it afforded.
He is quoted by Galen (op. cit. p. 398 M. [p. 422 K.]) for the remark
καθ’ ὃν λόγον οὐκ ἂν οἷπελπίσαι τις οὕτως τῶν πραγμάτων ἐγχρονιζομένων καὶ
τῆς παθητικῆς φλεγμονῆς ἀνιεμένης τὸν λόγον παρεισδυόμενον καὶ οἱονεὶ χώραν
λαμβάνοντα παριστάναι τὴν τοῦ πάθους ἀλογίαν-3. passage Which Cicero
seems almost to quote in 27, 64, ‘ipsa remissio luctus cum est consecula
intellectumque est nihil profici maerendo’ and again in 12, 26 ‘et
quidem inueterata malo, cum tumor animi resedzksetss Cicero's treatment
of the effect of time then is entirely opposed to that of Posidonius and
partially identical with that of Chrysippus, though he slurs over the
difficulty which the Greek philosopher frankly admitted.

(b) The value of praemeditatio was fully acknowledged by Chrysippus,
Galen op. cit. p. 392 M. [p. 417 K.]) καί φησι διότι πᾶν ro* α’μέτρητον καὶ
ξένον ἀθρόως προσπῖπτον ἐκπλήττει τε καὶ τῶν παλαιῶν ἐξίστησι κρίσεων
ἀσκηθὲν δὲ καὶ συνεθισθὲν καὶ χρονίσαν ἢ οὐδὲ ὅλως ἐξίστησιν αἷς κατὰ πάθος
κινεῖν, ἢ ἐπὶ μικρὸν κομιδῇ · διὸ καὶ προενδημεῖν δεῖν φησι τοῖς πράγμασι μήπω
τε παροῦσιν οἷον παροῦσι χρῆσθαι-ΨΙῚΕΓΕ προενδημεῖν expresses what Cicero
means by praemeditari.

(c) The consideration of the real nature and quality of the object
which has caused the emotion is recommended by Cleanthes (31, 76),
who held that the proper remedy for a‘egrz'tudo was to show that the
obiect was not malum, and by the Peripatetics (ib.) who recommended
