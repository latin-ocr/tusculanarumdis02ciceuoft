INTRODUCTION xlix

Again while the Peripatetic standpoint is most prominent in De Finn. v
(which is known to be derived from Antiochus) it is thrown into the
shade in T. D. v in which the Stoic standpoint is predominant. Cicero's
whole treatment of the questions discussed in the book is not dogmatic
but sceptical: he assumes the Stoic position, not because he is convinced
that it is the truth, but because it furnishes the most logical and con-
sistent proof of the thesis which he was really interested to maintain‚
that virtue was sufficient for happiness. This must have been the treat-
ment adopted in his source, which cannot have been a treatise of
Carneades, who fought bitterly against the Stoics‚ but of some other ad-
herent of the school of the Sceptics. This source was probably Philo.
This assumption is not contradicted by 24, 68, which seems to be due to
some dogmatic source, since the threefold division of philosophy there
referred to may be an addition of Cicero's or due to the retention‚ for
the sake of convenience, by Philo of a division which is as old as
Plato.

The introduction to the book (1, 1—4‚ 11) is admittedly Cicero's
addition to whatever source may be assumed for the book as a whole.
The praise of philosophy in 2, 5 is (though closely resembling sentiments
quoted from Posidonius by Seneca) more or less of a common-place and
the matter of 3, 7 ff. is Stoic in content where it is not directly borrowed
from Heraclides of Pontus. Cicero concludes his introduction by a
statement that he intends to employ, not the dogmatic, but the sceptical
method in the discussion, a method derived from Socrates by Carneades.
It may also be assumed without discussion that the section 5, 12 to 7,
20 need not be directly referred to any literary source.

With 8, 22 begins the formal discussion of the question which is the
principal thesis of the book, that virtue ensures absolute happiness. This,
Cicero contends, can only be maintained by assuming that virtue is the
only good, the philosophers who, admitting other bona besides virtue,
yet insisted that virtue was productive of happiness, being logically in-
consistent. The discussion of this point occupies the section 8, 22 to
26, 75.

Cicero begins with the assertion that he discussed the question often
with Antiochus and recently with Aristus during a visit to Athens.
Antiochus asserted the position (defended in his books) that virtue
produced happiness: this happiness was not absolute, there being certain
bona which virtue alone could not confer, but the happiness conferred
by virtue was sufficiently great to justify both the disregard of the partial
unhappiness that might be caused by the absence or loss of the other
bona and the general statement that the virtuous man was, on the whole,
happy. Cicero argues from the Stoic standpoint that there are no degrees
