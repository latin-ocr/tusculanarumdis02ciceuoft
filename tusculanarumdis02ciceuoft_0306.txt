244 TVSCVLANARVM DISPVTATJONVM [18. 51

XVIII. Quid ergo aut hunc prohibet aut etiam Xenocratem,
illum grauissimum philosophorum, exaggerantem tantopere
uirtutem, extenuantem cetera et abicientem, in uirtute non
beatam modo uitam sed etiam beatissimam ponere? quod qui-
dem nisi fit, uirtutum interitus consequetur. 52. nam in quern
cadit aegritudo, in eundem metum cadere necesse est; est enim
metus futurae aegritudinis sollicita exspectatio ; in quem autem
metus, in eundern formido, timiditas, pauor, ignauia; ergo, ut
idem uincatur interdum nec putet ad se praeceptum illud Atrei
pertinere:

Proinde ita parent 56 in uita ut uinci ne'sciant.

hic autem uincetur, ut dixi, nec modo uincetur sed etiam seruiet;
at nos uirtutem semper liberam uolumus, semper inuictam3 quae

305. The word bom· inserted in so many
MSS is apparently a care-less gloss, and

Aristoph. Ran. 1308 and the passage
from Julian quoted above, to the meaning

Ba. and Ml. suspect lancem as well; boni
is inaccurate as the difference between
the scales was not that one contained bona
and the other mala, but each a different
kind os bonum. Be. followed by Dav.
changed one gloss into another by reading
animi for boni, and Bouh. does no better
with honeslz‘; Ern. (followed by Mo. Kl.
Sch.) amplifies boni into bonorum animi,
which if lmnz' be not a gloss is the best
emendation (cf. Vahlen, opusc. Acad. ii
pp. 353 ff), and Sff. rewrites the words
altogether, reading praeponderare illam
lzanc lancem.

deprimat, ‘ outweighs ’ ; this, the same
phrase, is found in Fin. v 30, 92. As
Dav. points out, the use of the word is
technically incorrect if applied to the
effect of a heavier scale upon a lighter
one: but premo and its compounds had
acquired the secondary sense of ‘ to be too
heavy f0r‚' ‘to be superior to‚' and this
meaning possibly influenced the use here.
It is also possible that Cic. used deprimere
as a translation of καθέλκειν, which may
have been the word used in the Greek
source, and which passed from the mean-
ing of ‘drag down the scale,‘ seen in

‘ outweigh ³ seen, e.g. in Diog. Laert. vii
18.

XVIII. Xenocratem: cf. i 10, 20 n.
Dav. suggests that the ref. here may be
to his work περὶ ἀρετῆς in two books
mentioned by Diog. Laert. iv 12.

exaggerantem, ‘extolling,' as in 30,
85; iii 19, 45.

ἕ 52. nam in quem cadit: cf. iv 6,
14 sqq.

ergo ut idem uineatur: i.e. ergo in
eundem cadit, ut uincalur.

illud Atrei: the quotation is usually
assigned to the Atreus of Accius, but
Ribbeck, Scaen. Rom.Poes. Frgg. 12 p. 25 1
assigns it to the ‘incertae incertorum
fabulae.³ The line is an iambic senarius,
proinde being scanned as a disyllable‚
with elision of the last syllable.

hic: sc. z'n quem cadit aegritudo: the
autem following contrasts the character
under discussion with the style of character
implied by the advice of Atreus.

at nos: many edd. (including Dav. Tr.
Mo. Kl. K‘uh. Sff.) adopt the reading nos
autem, and Mo. conjectures that at is due
to dittography of the final syllable of the
preceding word. Wesenb. who reads at
