sed id=z¹mmo id naturally follows, cf.
Kiih. here. The emphatic repetition of
id within such a brief space has led some,
unnecessarily, to suspect the word. VVes.
Em. 1 p. 6 thought that it arose out of
sed.

haud sciam an plurimum :fortasse
plurimum. Haud sciam an affects a little
more diffidence than lzaud scio an, for

ergo: with ergo Cicero evidently draws
together his argument against the Cyre-
naics begun in ἓ 52· Compare ‘est id
quidem magnum...qu0d prouisum ante
non sit id ferire uehementius; sed non
sunt in lzoc omnia...quanta sint quae
accidunt considerandi spatium non datur’
of ἓ 5² with ‘ista necopinata non habent
tantam uim .. . omnis .. . feriunt enim ... ea
quae accidant. ..quia recentia sunt maiora
uz'dentur’ of our present passage.

The passage ‘ergo ista...repentina’
would come quite naturally immediately
after §52 and the context in ἓξ 53 soll.
would flow naturally from it. The argu-
ments summed up by ergo are all to be
found in ἓ 52. The ergo clause, where it
stands, is not in connexion with the pre-
ceding context, a fact noted by Heine,
and it interrupts the argument found in
that context. For in that context Cic.
asks what is the use of ratio and consolatio
and decides that these have their use.
After the interrupting clause ergo...re-
pentina he proceeds to state two ways
of ascertaining the real dimensions of a
seeming evil, with a view, as the context
shows, to reasoning with and consoling
those suffering from such seeming evils.

The clause ergo...repentina may have
originally stood after acriorem facit of
ξ 523 may have dropped out of ‘the
archetype, where it should have stood
near the head of a page, and been written
in the margin at the foot of the page;
and thence it may have got into the text
where it now stands.

enim: the argument is ‘annoyance is
not wholly caused by the unexpected:
the unexpected has some effect in its
production, feriunt enim, etc.'

non id efficiunt.. ι this passage is
rendered difficult by the fact that Cicero
1135 already said that all seeming evils
are more severe when repentzna (ἕ 28) or
inprouzsa (ξ 30) and repeats the assertion
with reference to the nec'opmatum in§ 59.
Hence Bentley conjectured and Dav. read

‘nam id efficiunt.. ; and VVes. Em. 1
p. 16 adopting Bentley' s nam read‘ uide-
antur; sed maiora uidentur, quia recentia
sunt, non quia repentinass comparing
variants in iv 26, 56 for non as a v. l. for
nam; and Hei. thought 11 not improbable
that Cic. wrote ‘non id efficiunt ut ea
quae accidant mala uideanturss the rest
being gloss; and Schiche adopts this
reading from Hei„ but keeps the rest as
in the text and adds 3 second mala after
repentina, an addition which seems to
give a very questionable clausula. Tur-
nebus conjectured‘ non id efficiunt ut ea
quae accidant maiora sznt3 quia recentia
sunt maiora uidentur non quia repentina,²
but this reading, though palaeographically
probable, yields a defective sense. uiden-
tur might have been substituted by
haplography for sint and changed of
necessity to adeantur, and quia recentia
sunt might have got into the margin, and
in replacing it in the text inversion, such
as we find in R, might have occurred.
But this would give a contrast between
sint and uidentur which is nowhere an
clement in the discussion while the real
contrast between recentia and repentina
would be less forcibly expressed.

Bouhier adopted the reading which is
now seen to be that of some of the best
MSS, including V, ‘non id efficiunt ut ea
quae accidant maiora uideantur; quia
recentia sunt maiora uidentur, non quia
repentinass and he 1s followed by Sff Or.
Bai. T.S. and Ml. Kiih. follows Mo.
in placing maiora uidentur immediately
after maiora uideantur, agreeing in the
rest with Bouhier.

The meaning is ‘the necopinata do not
by reason of their being necopinata make
the evil seem greater but by reason of
their being recentia. ’ Here and in ἓ 52
Cicero is in harmony with the Stoic
