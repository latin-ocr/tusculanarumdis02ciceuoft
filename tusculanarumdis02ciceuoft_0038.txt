xxxii INTRODUCTION

R. Hirzel (Untersuclzungen zu Ciceros philosopkischen Schriften, iii,
pp. 414 ff), reJeeting the views of Poppelreuter (Quae ratio intercedat
inter Posidonii περὶ παθῶν πραγματείας et Tusc. Disp. Ciceronis, Bonn,
1883), who claims Posidonius as the source, and of Heine (Einleitung
p. xxi) and Zietzschmann (De Tusc. Disp. fontibus, Halle, 1868), who
hold that Chrysippus was the source, argues in favour of the view that
Cicero derived his material and method of treatment from Philo. He
puts aside possible claims in favour of Panaetius and of Antiochus, of
the former on the ground that he admits “naturgemasse Lust'' in opposi-
tion to the view championed by Cicero, and of the latter on the ground
that though noted for his Stoic leanings and quoted incidentally on a
particular point by Cicero (25, 59) he would not have subscribed to
Cicero's polemic against the Peripatetics. The claims of Posidonius are
easily disposed of, as the view of the origin of the emotions apparently
taken by Cicero is opposed to all that Galen tells us of his doctrines in
the fourth and fifth books of his “De placitis Hippocratis et Platonis''
(pp. 330 ff. ed. Muller). Hirzel also claims that the known views of
Chrysippus on the proper method of curing the πάθη and of the value
of time as a remedia] agent are inconsistent with the possibility of any
work of his being the authority upon which Cicero relied. He takes the
general tone of the treatment to be evidence that a writer of sceptical
tendencies was the source. This consideration combined with the
marked Stoic leanings shown in the book points to Philo as the writer
upon whom Cicero relied.

Buresch (Consolationum a Graecis Romanisque scriptarum Historia
Critica in Lezpziger Studien ix pp. 1—170) considers that Cicero relied
upon Crantor and the other writers whom he had consulted in writing
his Consolatm, with occasional reference to Dicaearchus, Chrysippus and
others. He regards the following passages as either due directly to
Crantor or repeated from the Consolatio (Ι, 2; 6, 12; 13, 28, 293 14, 30;
16, 343 22, 543 24, 583 26, 633 28, 663 28, 70, 713 30, 733 31, 76)-

Pohlenz, in his article in Hermes (xli pp. 32 1—3 5 5, Das Dritte und
Vierte Buclz der Tusculanen), finds much in the book to point to
Chrysippus as the source or to be at least not inconsistent with his
views, while there are some points in which his doctrines are in contra-
diction to those expounded by Cicero. This latter he holds to be
perhaps most distinctly the case in regard to the question of the effect
of time upon the cure of aegritudo (cf. 22, 54 3 24, 58 3 30, 74 with the
sketch of Chrysippus' opinions given in Galen op. cit. pp. 394 ft). It is
however possible, according to Pohlenz, that Cicero while holding in the
main to Chrysippus slurred over (as indeed Chrysippus himself may
have done) the critical point upon which Posidonius (as quoted by
