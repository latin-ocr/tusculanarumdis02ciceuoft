of Menander’s Συναριστῶσαι (ἔρως δὲ τῶν
θεῶν Ι ἰσχὺν ἔχων πλείστην ἐπὶ τούτου
δείκνυται· Ι διὰ, τοῦτον ἐπιορκοῦσι τοὺς
ἄλλους θεούς) does not think the evidence
sufficient to warrant him in placing it
among the frgg. of Caecilius' Synaristosae
(op. cit. 11² pp. 68, 76).

existimat: the subject is Caecilius:
no doubt the word here in the play was
existimo.

eui: Em. followed by F.A.W. and
Ba. reads here cuius which must be
scanned as a monosyllable. The change
on metrical (or any other) grounds is
unnecessary as cuz' can be scanned as a
dissyllable with elision of the second
syllable.

sanari: Manutius' emendation‚adopted
by Lamb. Bent. Dav. Or. and all recent
edd. (except Kiih.) for the MSS insanire
which, as Bent. shows, introduces con-
fusion into the enumeration: dementem
esse is answered by sapere, and sanari by
in morbum z'nz'ci3 the scribe thought
that sapere should be followed by its
opposite and wrote insanire.

Bentley saw that after this line one had
been lost, as is shown by conlra in the
last line. He supplied the lacuna with
‘quem odio esse, quem contemni, quem
excludi foras-²

§69. praeclaram: ironieal, as in i
21, 49; Lael. 13, 47 ‘o praeclaram sapi-
entiam: solem enim e mundo tollere
uidentur, qui amicitiam e uita tollunt.'

emendatricem uitae: cf. ii 11, 273
iii 2, 3 sor similar complaints about the
poets. Xenophanes was, it seems, the
first to set the fashion in this; cf. his
lines quoted by Sext. Emp. Math. ix
193 πάντα θεοῖς ἀνέθηκαν ’Ὀμηρός θ’
Ἡσίοδός τε Ι ὅσσα παρ’ ἀνθρώποισιν ὀνείδεα
καὶ ψόγος ἐστίν Ι κλέπτειν μοιχεύειν τε καὶ
ἀλλήλους ἀπατεύειν. Plato’s outburst in
the third book of the Republic is well
known. It was the attempt to save the
poets (and especially Homer) from the
charge of teaching immorality that gave
rise to the allegoric system of interpre-
tation, which the Stoics seem to have
largely adopted in their attempt to fit
their theology on to the framework of
popular religion. On this question, cf.
Decharme‚ La Critz'que des traditions
relzgz'euses clzez les Grecs, pp. 270 ff.

Cicero here, of course, as the following
words show, is referring especially to the
later Greek poetry‚ principally comedy,
and its imitations in Roman literature,
which no ingenuity could defend against
his criticism.
