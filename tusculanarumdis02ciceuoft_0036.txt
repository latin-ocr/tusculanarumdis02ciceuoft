xxx INTRODUCTION

The best antidote to annoyance is a mind pleasantly occupied, as
Epicurus teaches. Such a mind is unaffected even by the awful calamity
of blindness, which might seem to deprive us of the noblest sense.
A philosopher can meditate in the dark, witness the examples of Dio-
dotus and Democritus: Homer was blind and yet how lifelike are his
descriptions 3 if Polyphemus bewails his blindness to the ram, it is because
the one was no more a philosopher than the other, §g 1 13-1 15.

Deafness, again, which is reckoned a missortune, is what we all
suffer from (in a sense) without pain 3 for everyone is deaf in respect
of a language he does not understand 3 and if a deaf man misses music,
he misses along with it many unpleasant sounds, and he can always
converse with himself, ἓ 116.

If, finally, a man is overwhelmed with all these at once, the remedy
is in his own hands—he need not continue to live 3 like a guest at
a banquet unable to partake of the good cheer he had better depart at
once. Epicurus and Hieronymus both sanction this remedy, §g 117, 1 18.

EPILOGUE. If Epicurus, to whom virtue is an empty name, can say
what he does of the happiness of the philosopher, why should not the
followers of Socrates and Plato who lay so much stress upon virtue in
comparison with everything else say at least as much? After all, the
difference between the Stoics and the Peripatetics is a mere matter of
terminology.

The five days' discussion being now over, Cicero promises to write an
account of them in five books which he will dedicate to Brutus in the

hope that they may confer upon others the same comfort that the
discussion has brought to himself, ἓξ 119-121.

THE SOURCES OF BOOKS III—V,

BOOK III.

The most divergent views have been propounded as to Cicero's
sources for this book. Posidonius, Chrysippus, Crantor, Antiochus,
Philo have each been named as Cicero’s principal authorities, though
the possibility of his having used such subsidiary sources as Panaetius,
Plato and Dicaearchus is admitted even by those who hold to the doctrine
of one main and principal authority.

It is hardly necessary to criticize each of these views in detail: it
will be sufficient to give the main grounds upon which the claims of

each authority have been urged, and develope any necessary criticism of
them in the analysis which follows.
