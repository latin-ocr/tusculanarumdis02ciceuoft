tu te, Thyesta, damnabis orbabisque luce propter uim sceleris
10 alieni? quid? illum filium Solis nonne patris ipsius luce indig-
num putas?

Refrigere oculi, corpus macie extabuit,

Lacrimae peredere umore exsanguis genas,

Situm inter oris barba paedore horrida atque
15 Intonsa infuscat pectus inluuie scabrum.

luce: by shrinking from the sight of
men he shrinks from the light of day.
Billerbeck compares Cato M. 4, 12 ‘nec
uero ille in luce modo atque in oculis
ciuium magnus, sed intus domique prae·
stantior.'

sceleris alieni: sc. of his brother
Atreus, who had murdered Thyestes’
children and served their flesh up to him.

finum Solis: Aeetes, king of Colchis,
son of Helios and Perseis (Homer's Perse,
Od. x 139). His brother Perses usurped
his throne. His daughter Medea, who
had left him with Jason when the latter
carried off the golden fleeee, returned
after many years in a car drawn by winged
dragous. Medus, her son by Aegeus, had
a little earlier been shipwrecked on the
Colchian coast and, finding himself among
enemies, had pretended to be Hippotes
the son of Creon. Supposing him to be
really Hippotes Medea persuaded Perses
to hand him over to her for slaughter.
Then discovering him to be her own son
she hands him a sword wherewith to
avenge the wrongs of his grandfather
Aeetes by slaying Perses. The lines that
follow were no doubt part of the spledus
of Pacuuius, and were uttered by Aeetes
who appears upon the stage in woeful
plight while Medea is talking to Medus.

The line announcing his entry preserved
by Festus ‘atque eccum in ipso ternpore
ostentum senem' must have almost im-
mediately preceded. Cf. Ribbeck’s Ram.

refugere oculi, ‘my eyes are sunken.'
The mette is iambic trimeter.

peredere, ‘have furrowed.’

situm inter oris: this correction of
Lachmann is nearer to situ nitoris the
reading of the MSS than even situ nidoris
and yields a much better meaning. It
would probably be written in uncial

mss Slssx—slNJ'ORIS with continuatim

stroke to denote the last two letters of
inter. The error would then consist
merely in missing the two top-strokes

and writing ΝΙ for ΙΝ, an error of the

most common kind. Situs lit. ‘a letting
alone’ is used of the coating of dust that
comes over objects lying by neglected,
cf. Prop. iv 5, 72 ‘inmundo pallida mitra
situ’3 or the scurf that comes over fields
left untilled, Virg. Geo. i 72 ‘segnem
patiere situ durescere campum'3 Aen. vi
462 ‘per loca senta situ'3 or of rust,
Tib. i 10, 50 ‘occupat arma situs.’
