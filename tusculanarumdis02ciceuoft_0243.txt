is, the exercise of the εὔλογος ἔκκλισις
which is analogous to, but distinct from,
fear. Dav.’s conj. cauere adopted by
F. A.W. Or. Ml. Hasper, Hei. gives a
similar sense and Dav. has no difficulty
in proving from 6. 13 above, Sen. Epp.
85 and Aug. C.D. xiv 8 that cautio was a
term in recognised use in this sense ; but
it is hard to see how cauere could have
been corrupted into confidere. Lamb.
followed by Bentley read dffdwe, but
the passage quoted by Dav. from Stobaeus
(Ecl. p. 183 (ΙΙ 6, 1 1)) τούτοις δ’ ἀκολούθως

ἀπιστίαν εἶναι ψεύδους ὑπόληψιν, τὴν δὲ
πίστιν ἀστεῖον ὑπάρχειν, εἶναι ’γὰρ κατάλη-
ψιν ἰσχυρὰν βεβαιοῦσαν τὸ ὑπολαμβανόμε-
νον seems decisive against it. Kl. and Mo.
defend the MSS reading, on the ground
that Cic. is merely concerned to emphasise
the broad distinction between the un-
ruffled placidity of the sapiens and the
various morbid emotions (and the expres-
sion ofthem) characteristic of the insipiens,
without going too closely into subtle de-
tails; and it must be admitted that Cic.
is not always so careful of his philosophical
vocabulary as to make us absolutely cer-
tain that he cannot have expressed himself
loosely here.

The corruption, if such it be, is as old
as Nonius Marcellus who quotes (de diff.
s.v. laetari p. 444 M.) our passage with

patria laudato R 7.

the reading considera Miiller in his edn.
of Non. Marc. (ii p. 35) suggests that
non confidere should be read here.

gaudere : the distinction between
gaudere and laetari seems to be observed
in Lucan vi 792 and 795.

§G'L supra: in 6, 14. Cicero‘s point
is that the approach of bonum induces in
the mind of the sapiens a feeling of elation
which is placida atque constans3 whereas
the approach of imagined evil, which in
the case of the insipiens causes aegritudo,
leaves the mind os the sapiens, to whom
no external event is an evil, absolutely
unmoved.

Naeuianus, ‘in Naevius,' cf. iii 26, 62
‘ Accianus. ²

Hector: in the Hector proficiscens,
Ribbeck, Scaen. Rom. R Rcll. 12 p. 8;
the line is quoted again by Cic. Fam. v
12, 73 xv 6, 1 and in Sen. Epp. 102, 16.

ille, ‘ the character in Trabea': the
name of the comedy is unknown: the
lines are to be found in Ribbeck, op. cit.
112 p. 31 and form the largest extant frg.
of Trabea. For another quotation from
Trabea see 15, 35. These and the pre-
ceding lines are trochaic tetrameters
catalectic.

digito: K'uh. compares Ter. Eun.ii 2,
53 (284) ‘ uno digitulo foris aperis.’

fores : Bent. followed by Dav. wished
to read ‘foris (fori') patebit’ here metri
