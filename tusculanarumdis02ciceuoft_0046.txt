xl INTRODUCTION

elsewhere is combatted by Cicero. While it is true that Cicero often
quoted from him in this book either directly or indirectly, he is at best
only a subsidiary source.

The remark in 6, 13 that, while aegn'tudo may be cured, yet the root
of it will remain, must not be pressed into an expression of even partial
or guarded sympathy with a view which regarded a certain amount of
perturbatio as natural and necessary, a view expressly disclaimed in 10,
22 and other passages. Cicero seems to mean here no more than what
Zeno himself admitted (cf. 22, 54 n. on ‘cicatricibus-²), though using a
different metaphor.

Cicero concludes this section with the statement that he will adopt
first the Stoic style of treatment and then following his own bent allow
himself a free rein.

The “Stoic treatment '⁹ is to be found in 7, 14 to 10, 21. So far as
the question of form is concemed it is “ Stoic '⁷ in the style of Zeno and
Chrysippus, not in that of Posidonius. The references in 7, 14 to infractio
animi and demissio animi are consistent either with Zeno's or Chrysippus'
expressions of their views and the phrases in 8, 17 ‘motus animi adpe-
tentis regere' and ‘adamantem libidini...seruare constantiam,’ while
perfectly consistent with the doctrine of· Posidonius, are not out of
keeping with the occasional loose phraseology of Chrysippus.

The digression on frugalitas is clearly derived either from Plato (see
the nn. ad. loc.) or more probably frorn Panaetius whom Cicero followed
in that section of the de Officiis (i 27, 93 ff.) in which the virtue of decorum
(τὸ πρέπον) is dealt with. The view there expounded of the relation of
σωφροσύνη to the other virtues is that of Panaetius (see Schmekel Die
Phil. d. Mittl. Stoa pp. 36 ff.) and is in marked contrast to the doctrine
of Zeno (whom Chrysippus seems to have followed in the main) that the
virtue which comprised all the others was φρόνησις (cf. Plut. de nirt. mor.
2 ἔοικε δὲ καὶ Ζήνων εἰς τοῦτό πως ὑποφέρεσθαι ὁ Κιτιεύς, ὁριζόμενος τὴν
φρόνησιν ἐν μὲν ἀπονεμητέοις δικαιοσύνην, ἐν δὲ διαιρετέοις σωφροσύνην, ἐν
δὲ ὑπομενετέοις ἀνδρείαν· ἀπολογούμενοι δ’ ἀξιοῦσιν ἐν τούτοις τὴν ἐπιστή-
μην φρόνησιν ὖπὸ τοῦ Ζήνωνος ὠνομάσθαι and Dyroff (Die Etlzik d. alt.
Stoa pp. 79 ff.)).

With regard to the quotations of Dionysius (9, 18) and Theophrastus
(10, 2 1) there is no reason why we should not assume that they may have
been derived from the materials collected for the Consolatio.

The whole section is interspersed with Cicero's usual Latin digressions,
discussions and quotations.

The following section (10, 22-3) furnishes a transition from the
“Stoic’' to the “freer‚'' rhetorical treatment which Cicero prefers. He
quotes the Peripatetic view of the mediocritates as one to which he cannot
