be anxious for some personal guidance 3 and happily nature has provided
a remedy for moral as well as bodily disorders, ἓ 58.

There are many methods of dealing with mental disturbance: one
may either argue the general question whether one ought ever to allow
his mind to be disturbed‚ or the particular question whether the patient
has in a given instance any adequate reason for disturbing his mind: the
former is the better course, as it can be applied to all caseS. One may
then show (a) that the object of fear or annoyance is not an evil or the
object of desire and delight not a good 3 or (b) that a state of mental
disturbance is in itself vicious, unnatural and unnecessary. Even those
who will not yield to argument (a) may still be persuaded to moderate
their emotions, and it must be admitted with regard to (b) that it is not
always successful or of general utility. Different arguments must of
course be used with those whose annoyance proceeds from conscious-
ness of a lack of virtue and desire to obtain it: but the view that
emotion (whatever be our view as to the value of the exciting cause) is
inconsistent with the grave and serious character of a philosopher ought

to be admitted universally‚ Q 59—61.

In dealing with libido or desire, even for virtue, one ought to deal
not with the value of the object desired, but dwell upon the effects
which this emotion produces in the mind 3 aegritudo or annoyance can
be cured by a consideration of the universal lot, though this point has
been dealt with in the previous book and in the Consolatio. Fear (an
uneasy emotion with regard to the future as annoyance is with regard to
the present) may be dispelled by the consideration (a) of its debasing
effect upon the character 3 (b) of the harmless nature of the chief objects
of fear, pain and death, which have been dealt with in Books Ι and ΙΙ,
Q 62-64.

Cicero now passes to the emotions caused by supposed goods‚ i.e.
delzglzt and desire. Here again the preferable method is to show, not
that the supposed goods are not real goods but that these emotions,
even if the objects of them be granted to be good, must not be carried
to excess (immoderate laughter ex. gr. is offensive) and are as vicious in
their own way as their opposites‚ Q 6 5—67.

A special case of the emotion of delight is the passion of love, the
most unworthy of all emotions. The poets praise it and attribute it to
the gods, and even philosophers have been found to patronize it: the
former even have praised unnatural vice. Stoic philosophers speak of a
kind of love which is a mere overture for friendship inspired by the sight
of beauty; if there be such an emotion it is harmless and calls for no
cure3 but the passion as ordinarily conceived is more akin to madness
and is so represented by the poets, Q 68—74.
