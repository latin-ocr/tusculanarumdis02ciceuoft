malum ut id obruatur sapientia uixque appareat, qui nihil opin-

rectum, se quam maxime excruciari luctuque confici, quo prauius

being understood. This reading is pos-
sible but not nearly so natural, and there
is some MS authority for omitting nam
while it seems possible to account for its
intrusion. See crit. n.

ξ 80. nescio quo pacto: i 1 1, 24 n. on
‘nescio quo modo.’ In 4, 7 A. had put
forward for discussion the assertion ‘uide-
tur mihi cadere in sapientem aegritudo‚'
but after section 21 this question is
dropped, and Cicero divides his subject
into two parts, the setting forth of the cause
of annoyance, and the discovery of its
cure.

cm· aut malum...tu.rpitudine: this is
the well-known strict Stoic doctrine. In
the qualifying clause aut z'ta paruum...
appareat Cic. is thinking specially of grief
sor the dead, and his thought is illustrated
by Sen. de Irai 16, 7 quoted in 22, 54 n.
on ‘cicatricibus.’

adfingat. adsumatque ..putet : these
subjunctives are very difficult. Bake pro-
posed to change all three (and possit also)
into indicatives, but it is hardly likely
that, apart from interpolation in the
archetype, which there is little reason
to suspect, all three words would have
been corrupted. The two clauses cuz· aut
malum uideri.. and qui nilzz‘l opinione...
read to me like coordinate clauses, and
the theory which makes qui=quippe qui,

(1 p. 292), rejecting the qui=quzppe qui
theory, places these subjunctives under
instances of attraction in relative clauses.
And Ι think that the preceding subjunc-
tives obruatur and appareat probably are
the cause of the error; but if so we have
here no ordinary instances of attraction in
rel. clauses, for that takes place when the
rel. clause is dependent upon the clause
containing the verb which is the cause of
the attraction, whereas the verbs in the
text are in a clause independent of the ut-
clause which contains the verbs which
exercise the attraction. As an alternative
to this theory it might be suggested that
Cic. wrote qmppe qui, as he would not
have expressed himself so ambiguously as
the text would make him do, if he meant
the qui-clause to depend upon the cui-
clause. But if we read quippe qui or take
qui as :quippe qui the meaning is unsatis-
factory, sor that would make this clause
give a reason for the sapiens thinking that
nothing can be an evil which is free from
baseness or that, if anything can, the evil
would be slight. It is obvious that isqui:
quippe qui it must refer to cui above and
could not refer to the ut id obruatur
clause alone. Ι believe that qui is a cor· »ξ
ruption for quoniam (εἴη-ι), a very slight ³
change, in which case we have a legiti-
mate attraction of the verbs that follow to
