in happiness and that to admit other bona besides virtue is, not to dilute
happiness, but to destroy it altogether.

Cicero’s statement as to the fact of his discussing the question himself
with Antiochus must be accepted: the only question remaining is whether
the treatment of the matter here is such as to make it necessary to assume
that he was copying or adapting the published work of some other person
who had opposed Antiochus’ conclusions from the same standpoint as
himself.

In 9, 24 he quotes and criticizes Theophrastus: the statement ‘ non
usquam id quidem dicit omnino, sed, quae dicit, idem ualent’ seems
undoubtedly to show that Cicero was relying upon his own knowledge
of the writings of Theophrastus, as well as his acquaintance with the
“libri et scholae omnium philosophorum'’ (9, 25) who criticized his views.
The references to, or quotations from, Epicurus in 9, 26 and 10, 31 are
so general as to make it absurd to assume that Cicero must have borrowed
or copied thern from some previous writer. Nor is it any more than an
assumption that the quotations from Plato in 12, 35 f. must have been
borrowed either from a platonizing Stoic like Posidonius or from some
other opponent of Antiochus. The references to Critolaus (17, 51) and
to Xenocrates (18, 51) are in both cases sufficiently superficial and
general to obviate the necessity of searching for a particular authority.
The passages (14, 413 15, 43—453 16, 483 18, 53> in which Cicero makes
conspicuous use of the laquei Stoicorum point undoubtedly to an
acquaintance with the method of argument employed by Chrysippus
and the earlier Stoics‚ and the “chain—arguments '' reproduced in these
paragraphs are no doubt translations or close imitations of the arguments
of some Greek Stoic. The long digression (20, 57 ff.) in which the evil
case of Dionysius is expounded is, no doubt, reminiscent of the habit
of Chrysippus: but it falls very far short of being evidence of direct
dependence by Cicero upon Chrysippus or upon any one else. The
somewhat contemptuous reference to Zeno in 12, 34 which Pohlenz
thinks to be an argument against regarding Posidonius as the source of
this section is not an argument either for or against anyone: it is, if
anything, an argument for Cicero's independence of any direct source,
being a dramatic adaptation of the expression to the situation. Cicero
is protesting against the assumption that he is bound to have adopted as
his own conviction the philosophical view which he may happen to be
advocating at the moment. His interlocutor is on the Peripatetic side,
and he is pressing the Stoic point of view not (he says) because he is
committed to its truth, but because it ‘nostros animos probabilitate
percussz't‚' “but‚’' he says, “if Zeno of Citium, that mere outsider and
low verbal mechanic, be considered to have wormed his way into
