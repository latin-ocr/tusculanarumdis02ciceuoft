xii INTRODUCTION

There were, according to them, two means for the abatement of
annoyance: (a) to call off the attention from the source of trouble 3
(b) to divert it to some pleasant thought such as might be supplied by
memory or anticipation‚ ἓ 33.

'But they are wrong to reject praemeditatio rerum futurarum and their
remedy, which consists in diverting the attention from the cause of
annoyance, is useless, ἕ 34.

praemeditatio secures a double advantage: (a) by meditating upon
the circumstances amid which we live a man performs the true duty of
a philosopher 3 (b) when missortunes confront a man he has a threefold
consolation: (a) he has long anticipated the possibility of the occurrence,
(β) he knows that the incidents of the human lot must be borne with
resignation, (γ) 116 knows that there is no evil where there is no moral
blame.

And who are the Epicureans to bid us ignore the annoyance at the
very moment when it pierces us and yet deny us all healing influence
from time? And, by the way, what are these good things to which they
would call off our attention? ἓ 35.

Here Cicero loses the thread of his subject in a tirade against the
views of Epicurus, ἐξ 36—51.

Pythagoras or Socrates or Plato might well rouse a man who was thus
succumbing to annoyance 3 they might bid him consider the four cardinal
virtues in turn, but Epicurus bids us think of pleasures‚ and those
pleasures the pleasures of sense. Epicureans need not deny it: the
assertion is proved out of the mouth of their cleverest man, Zeno of
Sidon, ἓξ 36—8, and from the work of Epicurus himself on the chief
good, ἓξ 41-42-

A fine life they prescribe and fine reflexions they would provide for
the solace of a Thyestes or an Aeetes or a Telamon or a captive
Andromache in distress, ἓξ 39, 40, 43—46.

Some may seek to defend Epicurus. It is true that he has uttered
many noble sentiments‚ but his statement of the chief good is only too
plain, c. 20, ἓ 46.

It need not be urged that he places the essentia] cause of happiness
in repose of mind. He contradicts himself, and he fails to distinguish
between pleasure and absence of pain, and he separates pleasure from
the chief good, ἕ 47.

But it may be urged that he often praises virtue. What of that?
C. Gracchus praised economy with regard to the public money. But
look to his acts, which the story of Piso Frugi serves to illustrate. So
Epicurus may assert that virtuous living is essential to happy living; he
may deny that fortune has any power over the wise man3 he may award
