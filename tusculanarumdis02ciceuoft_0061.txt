NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ APPARATUS CRJTJCUS.

THE MS designated V (V 1) in the critical notes is (as stated in the
Introduction to Vol. Ι, p. xxxi) damaged at the end of Book v: the
second column of the recto of f. 96 is imperfect and stained though still
legible and the same applies to the first column of f. 96 verso3 the
second column, ending in surditate uero (v 40, 116), is practically
undamaged: f. 97 is imperfect and much stained, the verso being almost
illegible. A second scribe has recopied these two leaves, i.e. from
aegritudinesque obliuione leniuntur (v 38, 110) to the end of the book.
Where V is still legible its readings are quoted, the readings from the
folios written by the later hand are denoted by v. A slight inaccuracy
in the statement made in Vol. Ι, p. xxxi may here be rectified: the note
added by the original copyist is M. Tullii Ciceronis Tusculanarum [ι’-ί) V
explicit feliciter.

The Bodleian fragment published by Professor A. C. Clark in
Me'langes pour H. Chatelain (Paris 1910) pp. 169 ff. is called F in the
critical notes 3 Professor Clark proposed to call it O, but that designation
was already in use for the group of Oxford Mss.

It may be added that, where a letter (ex. gr. R) used to denote a
group of MSS is employed without a number following, it denotes the
MS numbered (1) in that particular group 3 and that where Mss are
quoted for any reading and nothing is said about other Mss the others
have not been collated for that reading.
