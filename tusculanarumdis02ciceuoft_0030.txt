xxiv INTRODUCTION

of external and bodily evils, ᾖε could not take a very lofty tone 3 he is
blamed for this, but he has at least the merit of consistency 3 he is
universally blamed also for his view that fortune, not philosophy, is the
mistress of human life 3 but here again he is quite consistent. Why
should we imitate the inconsistencies of Epicurus who holds both that
pleasure is the only good, and that abstemiousness is praiseworthy3
that pleasure is happiness and yet that no one can be happy who does
not live virtuously 3 that pain is the greatest, nay the only evil, and yet
that fortune has little to do with the wise man? Metrodorus too defies
fortune in language which might become Zeno or Aristo but is incon-
sistent in the mouth of a follower of Epicurus, Q 24—27. Uneducated
persons are taken in by the language of these men but a trained mind
detects their inconsistency. Cicero's own position (the good are always
happy) is, however, free from this reproach 3 by the good (or the wise)
he means those equipped with all virtue 3 by happiness he means the
full possession of all good and the exclusion of all evil 3 it is necessary
then to deny the existence of any good except goodness, or virtue,
pain, poverty‚ slavery may befall the wise man, but as they are not evils
they cannot interfere with his happiness. Philosophers like Aristotle
and others who hold misfortunes to be evils are then inconsistent when
they say that the wise man is always happy. 1f they wish to deserve the
honourable name of philosophers they should despise misfortune and
seek happiness within 3 but they must not adopt at once the language
of the crowd and of philosophy; this is to be as inconsistent as Epicurus
who speaks as if he did not understand his own theories, gg 28-31.

Cicero's opponent here interjects that, though all this is plausible, it
is entirely inconsistent with the statement in the Fourth Book of the
De Finibus that Zeno differs from the Peripatetics only in terminology3
if this be so why should they not be allowed to use the same language
in regard to virtue in its relation to happiness? Cicero protests strongly
against an Academic being tied down to previous statements‚ and
points out that in any case he is at present only concerned with the
mere question of logical validity. If Brutus (for instance) wishes as a
Peripatetic to hold that the wise man is always happy that is his own
affair ς and Cicero only differs from him in holding that the wise man
is always absolutely happy, §g 32-34 init.

Resides, if Zeno be a parvenu in philosophy, one can go back to
Plato for the truth of the Stoic position: Plato makes Socrates in the
Gorgias identify happiness with virtue and in the Epitapln'os he lays
stress upon the sels-dependence of the wise man and his superiority to
external fortune or misfortune. It is entirely upon the authority of Plato

that Cicero will rely, §Q 34-36.
