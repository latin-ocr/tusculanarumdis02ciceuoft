Atlans: in Homer, Atlas appears to be
a divinity of the sea ὅς τε θαλάσσης Ι πάσης
βένθεα οἶδεν (Od. i 52); according to
Professor T. D. Seymour, Life z'n tlte
Homeric Age, p. 441 ‘he does not appear
to be a mountain; the columns which
support both earth and heaven appear to
be the sea itself.' In Hesiod‚ Theog.
517 ff„ 746 ff, he is a giant supporting the
heaven upon his head and hands, the
schol. at the latter passage drawing
attention to the discrepancy between
Hom. and Hesi0d3 cf. Aesch. P.V. 348.
In Ovid‚ Met. iv. 626, he is identified
with the African Mt. Atlas, into which he
is said to have been metamorphosed; so
Virg. Aen. iv 247, where see Servius’
note. The view that he was an astrono-
mer, about whose personality myths were
formed, is not put forward earlier than
Cicero's time (Hoffter quoted by Mo.),
and is probably due to the combined
influence of Euhemerus and the Stoic
allegorizing doctrines. It appears in
Virgil, Aen. i 741 ; Diod. Sic. iii 60; cf.
Paus. ix 20, 3.

There is a long astronomical explana-
tion of the myth in the Hesiodic Ἀλλη-
’γόριαι p. 475 (Gaisford, Poetae Minores
Gr. ii 579 sq.) in which Atlas is regarded
as an allegory for ἡ τοῦ παντὸς περιφορὰ
ἐπὶ τῷ agam Cornutus, Theol. Gr. c. 26
(p. 48, 9 ed. Lang), regards Atlas as a
synonym for ὁ ὅλος κόσμος.

Prometheus: cf. Hesiod, Theog.2 51 ff.;
Aesch. (RV. 457, 484) represents Prome-
theus as having taughtmankind astronomy
and μαντική. Cornutus, Theol. Gr. c. 18
(p. 31, 19 ed. Lang), allegorizes him in
the Stoic sashion into ὴ προμήθεια τῆς ἐν
τοῖς ὅλοις ψυχῆς.

stellatus: here in the sense of κατα-
στερισθεὶς, Milton's ‘starr’d’ (ll Pense-
roso 19), ef. Manilius, Astron. i 341 ; for
the usual meaning cf. Virg. Aen. iv 261
‘ stellatus iaspide fulua Ι ensis.’

cepheus, with his wife Cassiopeia, his
daughter Andromeda, and their son-in-
law Perseus, were transformed into stars ς
Cassiopeia had incurred the wrath of
Juppiter Ammon and the nymphs by
boasting of her beauty (Ovid‚ Met. iv
6073 fic. Aratea 44² ff.; Manil. Astr. i
350 ff. .

traduxisset. ; for traducere cf. iii 17, 37
where, as here, it bears the sense of
blringilng into another sphere of ideas or
t oug t.

ducti, ‘ descended ⁹: cf. ducere genus,
progeniem (Virg. Aen. v. 568; vi 835;
i 19).

ad Pythagorae. . aetatem : Pythagoras‘
lise may be set between 572 B.C. and
500 B.C.; v. R. and P. ἕ 54.

Heraclides: in his treatise περὶ τῆς
ἄπνου (Diog. Laert. prooem. 12). Hera-
clides was a pupil of Speusippus ἀλλὰ
