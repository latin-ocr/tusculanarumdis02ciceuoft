Even the site of Archimedes' grave had been forgotten until Cicero
discovered it when he was a quaestor at Syracuse; yet what cultivated
man would not prefer his life to that of Dionysius ?-the one exercised his
mind and reason in scientific investigation‚ the other in murder. What
wealth or power can compare with the life of a philosopher, who enjoys
the exercise of the best part of his nature, and is happy because he is
virtuous? ἓξ 64-67. But more cogent arguments can be advanced: let
us call up in imagination the character of the man distinguished for
virtue, intellect and mental energy, full of zeal for knowledge of
nature, of the laws of conduct and of thought: can we imagine any
greater pleasure than such a person derives from the study and contem-
plation of nature as seen in the heavens, in the facts of biology or physics?
He is led on from these to the realization of the truth of the Delphic
maxim, “Know thyself,” and to imitation of the gods who are the
upholders of the order of the universe. What peace and joy, what
independence of mind and feeling, are the result l He understands what
virtue is and how to live virtuously and happily; his trained mind is
incapable of yielding to false appearances. If he should engage in public ’
life, his knowledge and justice benefit the community 3 he enjoys the
blessings of friendship. What life can be happier? Is not such virtue
identical with happiness? ἓξ 68-72.

If Epicurus, who places all pleasure in sensation, can claim that the
wise man under the most cruel torments will smile at them with contempt,
what is to be said of the really wise man who is armed against bodily
pain by the virtues of firmness and fortitude, and has not to depend in
his pain merely upon the memory of past pleasures? If Epicurus can take
up this position why may not the Peripatetics? For even granting their
doctrine of the existence of other goods than virtue, provided these
others are allowed to be inferior to virtue, the virtuous man should be
supremely happy. Is pain to affright a philosopher, who, as we have
seen, is superior to the sear of death and other disturbing feelings?
Even youths in Sparta treat it with contempt 3 Indian sages are superior
to heat and cold3 widows in India are not afraid to be burned along
with a dead husband ,ε the superstitious Egyptian would endure any
torture rather than injure one of his sacred animals ; even brutes despise
cold and hunger and will die for their young ,- ambition and love lead
men to endure anything, §g 73—79.

The fact is that happiness and virtue are inseparabIe, and even
pain and torture cannot effect their divorce: the virtuous man has
nothing to regret, his every action is noble and right, he is proof against
the surprises of fortune, he is stable andindependent. Nothing can

’ confer greater happiness than this. The Stoics define the final good
