xxvi INTRODUCTION

praiseworffly, is virtuous. A good man's life then is happy. What else
has all that has been said been intended to prove? How can a man be
good whose feelings and acts do not proceed from what is praise-
worthy? What can be praiseworthy but virtue? Virtue therefore
ensures happiness, §g 46-48.

We may reach the same conclusion by another line of reasoning. In
a wretched life (or in one that is neither happy nor wretched) there is
nothing praiseworthy, nothing to be well spoken of. There must be
some kind of life in which there is something of this kind, a happy life
is such, forthere is nothing to be well spoken of but happiness 3 but
unless a virtuous life be a happy one there is something better than
happiness (virtue of course being better)—an absurd conclusion: and if
vice produces misery why should its opposite not produce the opposite?
Is not this the real teaching of Critolaus' illustration of the balance?
Why, if he admits virtue to be so superior to everything else, does he not
admit its power to confer absolute happiness? Annoyance produces
fear and servility of mind—the opposite of the freedom conferred by
virtue3 if virtue produces a good, i.e. a brave and lofty, life it must
produce a happy life, free from regret, abundant, unhampered and
(unlike the life of the foolish man) contented‚ §g 49—54.

Was not Laelius, who was virtuous and wise, happier than Cinna,
though the latter was consul four times and Laelius only once? There
are of course men who would prefer to be Cinna ,· but can a man like
Cinna, stained with the murder of Octavius, Crassus, Caesar and others,
be called happy? He was wretched, not merely because he was a
murderer‚ but because he had the heart of a murderer‚ Was Marius not
happier when he shared his glory with Catulus than when, without a
rival, he gave orders to murder him? Of the two Catulus was happier
even in death than the man who stained his glory and his last days
with crime, ἐξ, 54—56.

Dionysius of Syracuse, though temperate and energetic‚ was malicious
and unjust and, so, miserable3 in spite of his birth, high position and
crowds of favourites he practically lived in a prison owing to his suspicion
of everyone, even of his two wives3 a boy who made a harmless jest
was executed on suspicion of having meant more than he said. The
episode of Damocles showed what value Dionysius set upon his own
happiness : yet so deeply was he involved in evil that he could not ex-
tricate himself even if he wished. True friendship was denied him 3 his
artistic and musical, even his literary, talent could find no satisfaction3
he had to pass his life in the company of barbarians and ruffians, ἐξ 57—6 3.

To compare the life of a Plato or an Archytas with his would be
absurd. Archimedes, the mathematician of Syracuse, is a better parallel.
