INTRODUCTION xxxiii

Galen Le.) afterwards laid so much stress. It is possible that Cicero
may have been indebted to Antiochus, who defended Chrysippus against
Posidonius, for some hints on the treatment of the subject.

J. von Arnim (Stoicorum ueterum fragmenta i, pp. xx ff.) draws
attention to the confused and inconsistent treatment of the natural
causes of perturbationes and of their cure, as also of the criticism of the
Cyrenaics and Epicureans. He regards the crucial question to be
whether ἐξ 28 ff. are to be referred to Chrysippus or to Posidonius and
decides in favour of the latter, partly on the ground that the importance
given by Cicero to praemeditatio seems more consistent with the general
position taken up by Posidonius. On the other hand §g 24, 25, which
are inconsistent with Posidonius' views‚ are to be referred to some
authority who tried to mediate between the rival views of Zeno and
Chrysippus, traces of the same authority being also seen in ἓξ 28, 52,
58, 59 and 62. This authority is most probably Antiochus.

Kiihner (Prolegomena, p. 7, to his edition of the Tusculan Disputations‚
Hanover, 1874) regards Chrysippus’ treatise περὶ παθῶν as the source not
only of Cicero’s description of the passions but of his quotations from
Euripides and Anaxagoras. He allows the translation of Epicurus περὶ
τέλους in 18, 41 f. to be Cicero’s own and thinks he may also owe
something to Cleanthes, Crantor, Clitomachus and Antiochus.

Philipp Finger (Die beiden Quellen des Ill Buches der Tusculanen
Ciceros in Philologus Lxxxrv pp. 51 ff. and pp. 320 ff.) finds two sources
for this book, one a Stoic, and the other the eclectic Antiochus. He
divides the book between them as follows: gg 28—31 Stoic criticism of
the Cyrenaies 3 ἕξ32-37 Stoic criticism of the Epicuream, §338—51 criti—
cism of the Epicureans after Antiochus, §g 52—6 1 criticism of the Cyrenaics
according to Antiochus, ἕξω-7 1 after Antiochus, §372-84 from the Stoic
standpoint. He finds clear evidence of Antiochus being followed in
the paragraphs assigned to him above3 in ex. gr. §47 ‘uirtus maxime
expetatur' and ἓ 5ο ‘mila’ summurn z'n animo bonum uidetur,’ where an
orthodox Stoic would have said ‘uirtus sola' and ‘solum bonum’;
again in ἓ 58 ‘intellecto eo, quod rem continet, illud malum quod opina-
tum sit esse maximum nequaquam esse tantum ut uitam beatam possit
euertere' contains, he sayS, the kernel of the teaching of Antiochus in
opposition to that of the Stoics whose view was ‘nullum malum nisi
cuspa! The Stoic source he believes to have been Posidonius, the
Stoic sections of this book being a faithful reflexion of the reaching of
Posidonius as reported by Seneca, Epp. 87, 31 ff. The dualistic
psychology of Posidonius which appears in the introduction to the book
(ex. gr. §1 1, cf. iv, ἓ 34) has neither in Cicero nor in Seneca any influence
upon his teaching with regard to the moral character of the πάθη. Finger
