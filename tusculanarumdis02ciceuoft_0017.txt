existimo ') is now tacitly dropped (cf. ἓ 80 ‘sed nescio quo pacto ab eo quod
erat a te propositum aberrauit oratio, tu enim de sapiente quaesieras...’)‚
and Cicero divides his main subject into two parts, the setting forth of
the cause of annoyance and the discovery of its cure, ἕ 23.

Ι. The cause of annoyance, ἐξ 24—7 5.

1. The relation of aegritudo to the other emotions, and its
definition:—

The whole cause of the irrational emotions is a false opinion. Every
perturbatio is ‘am‘mi motus uel rationis expers uel rationem aspernans uel
rationi non oboediens) Irrational emotions are related thus, §g 24, 25 :—

, praesentis, laetitia, ἡδονή
Perturbationes b⁰m{ absentis, cupiditas, ἐπιθυμία
ex opinione , praesentis, aegritudo λύπη
ι, mah l absentis, metus, φόβος.

We must remove all these, and aegritudo now. Aegritudo is defined
as ‘opinio magni mali praesentis, et quidem recens opinio talis mali, ut in
eo rectum uideatur esse angl} id autem est ut is qui doleat oportere opinetur
se dolere.'

2. Analysis of the nature of aegritudo :—
It is—
<a) opinio magni mali praesentis, §5 28-61.

The Epicureans held that this opinion was inevitably produced by
every present great evil, the Cyrenaics only where such evil was unex-
pected. Cicero admits that the unexpected character of an evil tends to
intensify the resulting annoyance, ξ 28.

Hence ills that have been anticipated by reflexion fall upon a man
less heavily. Illustrations from the Telamon (?) of Ennius, from the
Theseus of Euripides, from Anaxagoras, from the Phormio of Terence,
§g 28—30.

Cicero accepts from the Cyrenaics this principle of praemeditatio as a
weapon against annoyance but sees in its effect a proof that annoyance
is due to opinion, not, as they held, to inevitable necessity, ξ 31.

Of the Cyrenaics in more detail anon: the view of the Epicureans
must first be dealt with. They held that where a man thinks himself to
be in evil he must necessarily be in annoyance, even though the evil has
been foreseen or is long-established. They even condemned the practice
of anticipatory reflexion upon evils, which may or may not occur, as a
gratuitous undertaking of additional annoyance, ἓ 32.
