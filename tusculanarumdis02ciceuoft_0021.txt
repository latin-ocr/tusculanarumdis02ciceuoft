INTRODUCTION xv

But there are motives which actually cause men voluntarily to incur
grief :—

(α) the conception of an evil as of such magnitude that we must
gr1eve;

(β) the idea that our mourning is acceptable to the dead 3

(γ) the idea that the gods are pleased at our sels-abasement beneath
their stroke.

The inconsistency of these popular views is apparent from the fact
that men are praised for meeting their own death calmly though they
are blamed for taking that of another in the same way, for it is nonsense
to suppose that anyone could love another more than himself, §g 72,
7 3 init.

Objections are untenable: if some are not influenced by consolatory
addresses this, so far from proving that their grief is not a matter of will,
serves only to show that they have made up their minds to grieve. If
some are too illogical to apply to their own case the good advice they
give to others in distress (eg. Oileus, g 71) they are not more inconsis-
tent than misers who blame the avaricious or than ambitious men who
condemn ambition. It is will that operates in all cases. Thus where grief
seems healed by time it is really by reflexion, for which time has given
opportunity, and not by time, that the cure is wrought. The Peripatetic
theory of the mean cannot apply. For if grief is a matter of inevitable
necessity why do they employ consolation? If, on the other hand, it is
incurred by an act of will, why not root it out entirely? Cicero sums up
the result of the enquiry as far as this point in the words ‘satis dictum esse
arbitror aegritudinem esse opinionem mali praesentis, in qua opinione illud
insit ut aegritudinem suscipere oporteat‚’ ἐξ 73, 74.

(c) Lastly Cicero says that Zeno rightly adds to the definition of
aegritudo the qualification that it be recens, this word not being limited
to a strictly temporal meaning but applying so long as the belief in the
evil retains fresh vigour and force. The grief of Artemisia, for instance,
remained recens in this sense until she died through its effect, ἓ 75.

ΙΙ. The remedial treatment of annoyance, ἐξ 7 5-79 end.

Different remedies are put forward by different philosophers. Some
combine all these remedies, since some are affected by one, some by
another 3 this is the method adopted in Cicero's own Consolatio where
he tried every possible remedy, still, as Prometheus says in Aeschylus,
one must wait for a suitable opportunity for administering the proper
treatment.

In administering consolation one will show that the evil is non-
existent or very small 3 that it is incident to the human lot 3 that grieving
