philosophy '’ then let us take Plato and leave him aside. To attempt to
use such a phrase as evidence either for or against a particular literary
“ source '' is childish.

It is extremely unsafe to infer from 24, 68 fin. in which philosophy
is divided into physics, ethics and logie that the section in which the
divisions are arranged in this order must be derived from Posidonius. It
is true that he adopted this particular order: but so did Panaetius, as is
expressly stated by Diogenes Laertius (vii 40, Παναίτιος δὲ καὶ Ποσειδώνιος
α’πὸ τῶν φυσικῶν ἄρχονται), who makes it plain that there was con-
siderable divergence among the Stoics on the point. In any case
an order which goes back to Panaetius is not valid evidence that a
passage in which it occurs ought probably to be referred to a work
of Posidonius.

There is nothing in the section which compels us to assume direct
dependence upon any particular author or treatise. Cicero was no doubt
aware of what was to be said, and had been said, from the Stoic stand-
point against the views of Antiochus. He took his arguments where he
found them, and he may have found some of them in Posidonius, though
most of them are sufficiently obvious to have occurred to any one
interested in the discussion. But if he discussed the matter often
with Antiochus <by which he certainly does not mean that he repeated
to him extracts out of Posidonius) there is no reason why he should not
have composed this section without taking a treatise of either Posidonius
or Philo as the groundwork of his treatment.

Having shown that the Stoic ethics alone furnished an absolutely
satisfactory basis for his main thesis, Cicero proceeds to examine what
may be said for it upon the basis of other ethical systems (27, 76 ff.).
Assuming the threefold division of bona, he enquires whether, supposing
the bona corporis and the bona externa to be practically equivalent to the
Stoic προηγμένα, the same result will not follow. Of course, if these two
classes of bona are sufficiently depressed the result is the same as on the
Stoic hypothesis, and Cicero refers to the discussion in the previous
books, as well as to fresh examples (27, 77 ff.)‚ to sustain the inference‚
repeating some of the more extravagant statements of the Stoics and
declaring that their statement is the most courageous that can be made
(28, 80 ff.). No one seems inclined to look for any source here beyond
Cicero himself.

He proceeds in 29, 82 ff. to examine the question how far it is
logically consistent with the views of the Peripatetics and Academics to
assert ‘sapientzs esse semper beatissimos.' Carneades had asserted that no
matter what view was held de finibus virtue possessed ‘satis ad uitam
beatam praesidii' (29, 83), and this being already proved in regard to the
