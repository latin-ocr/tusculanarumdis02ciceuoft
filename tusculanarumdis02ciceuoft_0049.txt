INTRODUCTION xliii

Von Arnim l. c. pp. xxvi ff. considers that the book is of composite
origin 3 §g 11-33 come from a source which while it is not a work of
Chrysippus inclines on the whole to his doctrines. The rest of the book
is from some other source, as no one holding the views of Chrysippus
would use the arguments urged here against the Peripatetics.

Heine (de sontibus T usc. Disp. Weimar 1863 pp. 13 ff.) holds that in
cc. 4—1 5 a handbook based upon Chrysippus' περὶ παθῶν was the source:
in cc. 15-—27 the same book, supplemented by Crantor περὶ πένθους, was
the ultimate source ; while the remainder of the book is based not upon
a philosophical but upon a rhetorical treatise.

Ph. Finger op. cit. p. 348 considers that the sources of this book, as
of the preceding, are Antiochus and Posidonius, whose influence he
divides as follows: §g 37-46 aster Posidonius; ἓξ 47-56 after Antiochus 3
ἐξ 57-65 after Posidonius, gg 66-78 after Antiochus 3 ἓξ, 79 ff. after
Posidonius.

Upon the question of the origin and nature of the πάθη Cicero adopts
in this book practically the same ground as in the preceding book. In
5, 9, 1 1 he names “Chrysippus et Stoici'' as the philosophers who devoted
most attention to the classification and definition of the emotions and
declares his intention of following them in this part of his work ; and
where he quotes his authority for a definition it is always a Stoic, eg. 6,
11 (Zeno), 14, 33 (Stoici), 21, 47 (Zeno), 24, 53 (Sphaerus and Chrysip-
pus). But with regard to the question in dispute between Zeno and
Chrysippus as to whether the δόξα, opinio, constituted the emotion or
caused it we have the same uncertainty and vacillation as in the previous
book. In 6, 11 a perturbatio is an animi commotio, which is Zeno’s
definition: in 6, 14 aegritudo is an animi contractio ; while five lines lower
down it is defined as an opinio...in quo demitti contrahique animo rectum
esse uideatur. In 7, 15 he regards the perturbationes as the source of the
recessus animi and the other mental states which Zeno considered to
constitute the perturbationes. Again in 15, 34 the definition ofperturba-
tiones as turbidi motus is Zenonian and in 21, 47 Zeno's own definition
is quoted with approval. In 27, 59 two other and shorter definitions ad-
petitus uehementior (ὂρμὴ πλεονάζουσα) and aspernatio rationis (ἄλογος
κίνησις) are adopted, which though Zeno's (Diog. L. vii r 10) do not raise
the immediate point of controversy and may be reconciled with eitherview.

It is therefore surprising to find Cicero in 5, 10 announcing that while
he intends to employ Stoic definitions (i.e. the definitions of Zeno and
Chrysippus) he is an adherent of the rival view, derived from Pythagoras
and Plato, which regards the soul as partly rational and partly irrational:
the latter being the seat of the emotions of anger and desire (τὸ θυμοειδές
and τὸ ἐπιθυμητικόν), the former the placid and quiet seat of the controlling
