quis enim potest, in quo libido cupiditasue sit, non libidinosus
et cupidus esse? in quo ira, non iracundus? in quo angor, non
anxius? in quo timor, non timidus? libidinosum igitur et ira-
15 cundum et anxium et timidum censemus esse sapientem? de
cuius excellentia multa quidem dici quamuis fuse lateque pos-
sunt, sed breuissime illo modo, sapientiam esse rerum diuinarum
et humanarum scientiam cognitionemque quae cuiusque rei
causa sit. ex quo efficitur ut diuina imitetur, humana omnia

cupiditasue...et cupidus. There is no
necessity to alter the reading either to
cupiditasque with Bouh. or to aut cupidus
with Dav.‚ as there is no difference
between libido and cupiditas: to be
possessed by either is to be possessed by
both.

libidinosum igitur: the words et
cupidum which follow in some MSS. are
evidently a mistaken attempt to complete
the list of adjectives.

quamuis=quantumuis as in 24, 53, ·
the reading possint of many MSS. is
perhaps due partly to the influence of the
supposed meaning of quamzczs ‘galthou h’
as well as to the misreading of the con-
traction sor possunt. For fuse lateque
cf. Or. 32, 113 ‘ facultatem...fuse lateque
dicendi.’

sapientiam...eausa sit. : for this defini-
tion Dav. compares v 3, 7 : Off. ii 2, 5
‘ sapientia autem est. . .rerum diuinarum et
humanarum causarumque quibus eae res
continentur scientia’; Orig. in Celsum iii
p. 494 ὴ σοφία ἐπιστήμη θείων ἐστὶ καὶ
ἀνθρωπίνων πραγμάτων καὶ τῶν τούτων
αἰτίων and Sen. Epp. 89, 5 who objects
to the last clause in the definition as
superfluous, ‘quia causae diuinorum hu-
manorumque pars diuinorum sunt.’ Cic.
employs this shorter form himself in Off. i
43, 153. The definition seems to be due
to Pythagoras 3 see Hobein’s n. to
Maximus of Tyre, xxvi 1 (p. 308), where
many other quotations of it are referred
to.

Em. Clau. Cic. s.v. diuinus points out

that of the three divisions of philosophy,
dialectics, physics and ethics‚ res diuinae
correspond to physics including natural
theology, while under res humanae he
classes ethics and dialectics. But why
should dialectics be a sub-division of res
humanae any more than of res diuinae?
Undoubtedly the scientia quae cuiusque
rei causa sz't is τὸ λογικόν, which including,
as it did, the discussion of τὰ κριτήρια
τῆς ἀληθείας was necessarily concerned
with first causes. Seneca's objection to
its being included in the definition of
philosophy may be explained partly by
his contempt for dialectics, partly by the
fact that the causae cuiusque rei though
really the province of τὸ λογικόν might
very naturally be regarded as falling
equally within the province of τὸ φυσικόν
and τὸ ἠθικόν respectively. This indeed
would seem to have been a view recog-
nized generally by the Stoics for the
purposes of instruction; cf. Diog. L.
vii 40, who speaking of the threefold
division says καὶ οὐθὲν μέρος τοῦ ἑτέρου
ἀποκεκρίσθαι, καθά τινες αὐτῶν φασιν,
ἀλλὰ μεμίχθαι αὐτά· καὶ τὴν παράδοσιν
μικτὴν ἐποίουνε and Chrysippus quoted
by Plut.<1e Stoic. rep. 9, p. 1035 Ε οὐ
καθάπαξ ἀφεκτέον ἐστὶ τῶν ἄλλων τῷ τὴν
λογικὴν ἀναλαμβάνοντι πρώτην ἀλλὰ
κάκείνων μεταληπτέον κατὰ τὸ διδόμενον.
quae...sit: the verbal noun cognitio
takes the construction os cognoscam cf.

pro Sull. 1, 3 ‘iudicium qui...uideatur'
with Reid's n.
