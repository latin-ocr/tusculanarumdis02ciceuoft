where these were to be found nor what
they really were....'
alii...alii: Cicero is thinking of Caesar
and Pompey, as Hei. notes.
atque...quidem‚ ‘moreover‚⁷ ‘and
indeed.' Cicero passes from the case of
ambition to the still stronger cases of
avarice, etc. The formula atque...quz'-
dem...is suited to such transitions. See
Kiih. here and Hand Tursell. 1 p. 49²
foll. A personal or, as here, a demon-
strative pronoun often follows to mark
the correspondence of clauses. lzz' is alone
right; the logical pronoun ei would not
suit for this purpose. ‘ And while such
men with the best of aims go wrong‚...
though not wilfully it is true but through
a mistake with regard to the course,
what of those who are carried away by
avarice ..?'
cursus: gen. of indirect object. See
Naegelsbach, Stil. ξ 120.
uoluptatum libidine: cf. Sen. 12, 39
uoluptatis auidae libidines'3 40 ‘libido
uoluptatis.'
quod insipientibus contingit omnibus :
this Stoic commonplace comes in most
ineptly here and is rightly bracketed by
Bake, whom Bai. and Hei. follow. Ml.
and others retain the words. T.S. would
make the inaccuracy Cicero’s own and
Kiih. thinks that in these hastily written

books we must not be too critical. But
though Cicero is often betrayed by haste
into inaccuracies of construction it is
hardly likely that so great an orator
would thus destroy his climax. The
clause seems evidently a mere gloss upon
the word insania.

ΙΙΙ. ἓ 5. at et: the clause at et morbi
perniciosiores pluresque sunt animi quam
corporis answers the question utrum quod
minus noceant animi aegrotationes quam
corporis. We ought therefore to have a
second et-clause to answer the second
part of the preceding double question
an...anz'morum medicina nulla est, such
clause running somewhat as follows—et
animi medicina certe est, but the inter-
vention os the explanation why the diseases
of the mind are more harmsul than those
of the body hoc enim zpso... grauiores has
caused the construction to be broken off
and the an-clause is answered in a new
sentence qui uero probari potest...leaving
et pendens.

hoc enim ipso: the correction of Bake
for kz· enim ipsi of the MSS is accepted by
most editors except Sff. The argument
is ‘diseases of the mind are more harmsul
(and more numerous) than those of the
body. They are troublesome from the
very fact that it is the mind which they
affect and disturb; and the ailing mind
