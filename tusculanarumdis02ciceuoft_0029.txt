INTRODUCTJON xxiii

Proof of the Proposition that Virtue is Sufficient for a Happy Life,
ἓξ 15—82.
A. The proof in syllogistic form, §g 15—20.

If the results arrived at in the discussions of the precedings days are
valid (as they admittedly are) then the matter is easily disposed of; for,
(1) men who are under the influence of such emotions as sear, annoy-
anee, lust, etc. are unhappy, (2) men who are subject to none of these
are tranquil and therefore happy3 (3) this tranquillity is produced by
virtue 3 therefore virtue is in itself sufficient to produce happiness,
ἐξ 15—173 Cicero's opponent admits the premiss that freedom from
emotion and passion produces happineSS, while he also grants that the
further premiss that the wise man is free from emotion and passion has
been proved on the preceding days, and it seems as if there were no
more to be said, g 17.

But Cicero admits that a proof by axioms, after the style of geometers
and Stoics‚ is unsatisfactory in a philosophical discussion which requires
and is conceded, even by the Stoics‚ a broader treatment. Besides, the
conclusion is too important to be dismissed so briefly; happiness,
which even Xerxes with all his power and wealth could not secure, must
be put beyond the reach of doubt, ἐξ 18—20.

B. Detailed consideration of various arguments, §g 21—82.

Cicero's opponent here declares himself ready to admit the logical
validity of the two positions (a) The only good is what is honestum,
therefore virtue produces happiness, and (b) A happy life consists in
virtue, therefore virtue is the only good3 but he objects that other
philosophers, such as Aristus and Antiochus, hold the existence of
other goods than virtue. Cicero's reply is that the question of the agree-
ment with their own premisses displayed in the conclusions of others
must be discussed elsewhere3 he has discussed the matter with the
philosophers named 3 his own position was, and is, that if bodily infirmi-
ties and misfortune be evil, then since the wise man can be subject to
such things, and no man can be happy surrounded by evils, it is
possible for the wise man not to be happy. Antiochus holds that while
such things are evils yet happiness (like most words of the kind) is a
relative term, and that a man may be happy, even though he is subject
to some evils. Since Cicero will not go into the question at this stage
he contents himself with saying that he cannot conceive degrees of
happiness, nor can he see how, if of the three kinds of evils (bodily,
external and moral) a man is subject to the first two, he can be
described even as relatively happy, ἐξ 21—23. Theophrastus, he proceeds
(still labouring the digression), felt the difficulty, admitting the existence
