INTRODUCTION xxv

Where then must we search for our premisses? Clearly in nature,
which aims in everything at sels—development and perfectiori. This is
true not only of the vegetable, but specially of the animal, world 3
every species remains true to its own natural development; and much
more of man, whose principle of development is the divine principle
of reason, whose cultivation brings enlightenment and whose perfection
is virtue: and since to be perfect is to be happy, then all virtuous men
are happy. So far the Peripatetics go: but Cicero goes farther and holds
this happiness to be absolute, since happiness which cannot be depended
upon to continue is not happiness at all, and if there be such goods as
bodily and external goods (upon which no one can depend) real happi-
ness is unattainable 3 the happiness which such goods confer is like
the merchant's fortune tied to his rigging—nothing that may be lost can
confer happiness. True happiness is at once indefectible and complete,
just like courage (ex. gr.) which fears, not little, but nothing. Such
happiness is impossible if there be any good but virtue, the only
possession which confers confidence and independence 3 the virtuous
man is like the Lacedemonian state which no threat could terrify nor
death dismay—such fortitude combined with self-control is of the
essence of virtue, §g 37—42.

If it be true, as it is, that fancied goods and fancied evils produce
mental disturbance at variance with reason, must not the man who is
free from these be happy? The wise man who is always free from
them is therefore always happy. Further every good gives pleasure 3
what gives pleasure is to be well spoken of, and what is to be well
spoken of is glorious and so praiseworthy, that is to say virtuous
or honestum, and therefore ‘the good ' is identical with virtue: but no
one would call an external good honestum, such a ‘ good' therefore is
not ‘the good.' Must not a man in possession of all possible external
goods be wretched if heis unjust, intemperate or cowardly; how then
can such things which cannot confer happiness be called good? A
happy life must be homogeneous‚ it cannot admit of anything but what is
good. The good is an object of desire, and therefore of approbation, and
of worth and deserving of praise3 nothing but virtue is such, ἐξ 43—4 5.

We must abandon this view if other things are to be called good :
if riches, birth, popularity, beauty are goods, philosophers are no better
than the crowd. The Stoics call such things ⁶ objects of preference'
(producta, praecipua) but not ‘goods' and not capable of producing
happiness: even the Peripatetics admit they do not confer absolute
happiness, the only happiness we are concerned with. A man is what
he feels 3 what a man says, he is ; his life is as his doctrines 3 a good
man's feelings are praiseworthy, so is his life and therefore his life, being
