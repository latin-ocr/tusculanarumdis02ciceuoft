INTRODUCTION xiii

the preference to frugal fare ; he may assert that the wise man is at all
times happy—all these utterances are inconsistent with his doctrine with
regard to pleasure, §g 48, 49.

Epicureans complain that this is to attack Epicurus in the spirit of a

partisan. A very likely story! This is no exciting question and yet even
exciting questions such as questions of war can be argued without
acrimony, as the case of Cato and Lentulus shows, §g 50, 51.

To return to the view of the Cyrenaics: they hold that where
annoyance arises the occurrence which causes it is unexpected. This is
an important point: and Chrysippus also holds that the blow is heavier
where it is unexpected. But this is due to two causes: (a) the suddenness
of the occurrence prevents us from rightly measuring its true dimensions:
(b) the annoyance is increased by a feeling of sels-accusation due to the
idea that the occurrence might have been foreseen, ἓ 52.

That this explanation is correct is shown by the case of enslaved
captives: though their evils continue unchanged their annoyance is not
only abated but in many instances removed by lapse of time. Examples
are furnished by Carthaginians, Macedonians, Corinthians, ἓ 53.

When Carthage was destroyed Clitomachus thought it necessary to
console his fellow—countrymen with a book which we have read. Had he
delayed the sending of it for a number of years there would have been
no wounds to heal‚ g 54.

Accordingly it is not because they are unexpected that misfortunes
loom large upon us but because they have newly occurred 3 quia recentia
sunt maiora uidentur, non quia repentina, ξ 5 5.

There are two ways in which we may ascertain the real dimensions of
a seeming evil (or a seeming good)—We may examine its real nature,
take e.g. the case of poverty; or we may illustrate it from the behaviour
of individual men, e.g. Socrates, Diogenes, Caecilius' philosopher in a
mean cloak‚ Fabricius: such instances‚ when placed before us, gradually
bring us to a perception of the true dimensions of the supposed evil (or
good). And previous reflexion upon possible future evils brings about
the same result as is produced by lapse of time: the true dimensions of
the supposed evil are better seen, §g 56—59.

Antiochus writes that Carneades used to blame Chrysippus for quoting
from Euripides in illustration of the inevitability of pain and woe, assert-
ing that such sentiments could only bring consolation to spiteful persons.
But Cicero thinks otherwise, holding that the inevitability of the human
lot forbids us to fight with the deity and that the citation of examples is
calculated not to delight the spiteful but to bring people to resolve to
endure what they find that many have endured, ἕξ 59-60.

Annoyance is a terrible thing, compare Chrysippus’ derivation of the
