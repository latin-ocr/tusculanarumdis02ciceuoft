And with the importance of the practical end tending to overshadow
in his mind the importance of scientific accuracy, Cicero might have
appealed in defence of his comparative carelessness of philosophical
pedantry to the dictum of Chrysippus that whatever be the view held as
to the ultimate values of things the πάθη ought to be eradicated. Origen
(c. Celsum viii 51) quotes from Chrysippus' περὶ παθῶν θεραπευτικός the
sentence κᾶν γὰρ τρία ᾗ γένη τῶν ἀγαθῶν καὶ οὕτω θεραπευτέον τὰ πάθη· οὐ
περιεργαζόμενον ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τῆς φλεγμονῆς τῶν παθῶν τὸ προκαταλαβὸν
δόγμα τὸν ὑπὸ τοῦ πάθους ἐνοχλούμενον, a statement Which evidently under-
lies Cicero’s discussion in 28, 60. This will not, of course, excuse
indifference to distinctions of doctrine in a philosophical treatise, but it is
an assertion of the occasional importance of the practical in contrast to
the theoretical which is capable of a wider application than Chrysippus
intended.

The conclusion seems to be that Cicero, while an adherent in principle
of the Platonic psychology (espoused by Posidonius), did not consider
the points of controversy between the Chrysippean and Platonic forms
of Stoicism sufficiently relevant to his object to prevent his adopting the
phraseology of the Chrysippean school in dealing with the perturbationes :
but that he judged it necessary to state briefly his own personal preferences
in the matter (perhaps merely to satisfy himself or to guard against
criticism) 3 and that it being a matter of indifference where this statement
was made its appearing here rather than elsewhere is largely accidental.

The introduction (cc. 1—5) is of course Cicero’s own both in expression
and content. His sketch of the history of “ philosophy '' in Italy and his
insistence upon the influence of Pythagoras and the necessity for a
“ cultured '’ philosophy perhaps led him by an association of ideas to a
declaration of his own personal preference for the Pythagorean-Platonist
school. But he makes it plain (5, 9) that while he will adhere to
Chrysippus and the Stoics in matters of definition and proof, he will
adopt the more humane methods of their rivals when it comes to the
application of the lesson.

The following Chapters (cc. 6-14) are derived from Zenonian and
Chrysippean sources. This is shown not merely by the direct testimony
of Cicero (6, 11 (Zeno), 10, 23 (Chrysippus)) but by the character of the
whole passage. The minute subdivision of the various πάθη into meticu-
lously defined particulars is eminently characteristic of Chrysippus, to
whose σμῆνος ἀρετῶν an equally elaborated σμῆνος κακιῶν was no doubt
contrasted.

The passages (10, 23 f.‚ 12, 27 f.) in which the comparison between
physical and moral disorders is referred to seems to exclude the possi-
bility of any use of Posidonius, who criticized Chrysippus in detail upon
