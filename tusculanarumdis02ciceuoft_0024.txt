xviii INTRODUCTJON

From perturbationes spring diseased cravings (morbi) and vieious
habits (aegrotationes, ἆῤῥωστήματα), and, as errors of an opposite kind,
diseased aversions (ffnsiones). The Stoics‚ and especially Chrysippus,
push this parallel between diseases of the body and those of the mind
too far, ἓ 23.

These morbi, aegrotationes and offensiones are illustrated in detail,
ἐξ 24-7·

Further parallelism between the health of the body and that of the
mind, ἓξ 27—8.

And, as in the body we find diseases‚ chronic ailing states and
deformity‚ we find corresponding evils in the mind. Definition of
uitiositas, §g 28, 29.

And there is the same parallelism between good conditions of the
mind and those of the body as there is in the case of evil conditions‚
§s 30, 31·

They differ in this that the mind while sound cannot be assailed by
disease but the body can, c. 14, ξ 31.

How the elever differ from the dull as regards the irrational emotions.
Morbi and aegrotationes are more difficult to uproot than uitia animorum,

ἓ 32.
(c) Transition to the second division of the subject, g 33.

B. Refutation of the Peripatetic defence of the emotions, gg 34—5 7.

Virtue being a settled and laudable state of the mind, giving rise
to good desires and actions, and its opposite uitiositas, which the
Greeks call κακία, giving rise to irrational and disturbing desires, the
only method of getting rid of these evil results is to be found in virtue,
ἓ 34·

Nothing can be more wretched and revolting than the sight of a man
who is the slave of an emotion‚ for instance, of sear (like Tantalus): and
foolish men are always such 5 emotions like desire and exultation are just
as soolish3 the only person who is free from them all is the wise man,
§s 35› 36·

The wise man free from these disturbing emotions is certainly
happy. How can he be mistaken in his judgment of the importance
of any event who has studied the constitution of things and is on guard
against surprise? His keen vision sees that the only home of peace is a
quiet mind, free from disturbing emoti0n‚ while a mind ill at ease loses
its health‚ ἐξ 37, 38.

How then can the Peripatetics adopt the effeminate view that a
certain limited amount of emotion is necessary to man? The emotions
are all contrary to reason, and nothing that is so can be tolerated.
