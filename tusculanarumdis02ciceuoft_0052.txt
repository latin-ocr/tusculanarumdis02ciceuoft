xlvi INTRODUCTION

this very point. Galen, op.ct’t. p. 408 M. [p. 433 K.]‚ οὔκουν ὀρθῶς εἰκάζεσθαί
φησιν ὑπὸ τοῦ Χρυσίππου τὴν μὲν ὑγίειαν τῆς ψυχῆς τῇ τοῦ σώματος ῧγιείᾳ
τὴν δὲ νόσον τῇ ῥᾳδίως εἷς νόσημα ἐμπιπτούσῃ καταστάσει τοῦ σώματος. . . .
ἀλλὰ δικαιότερον εἶναι προσεικάζειν τὰς τῶν φαύλων ψυχὰς ἤτοι τῇ σωματικῇ
ὑγιείᾳ ἐχούσῃ τὸ εὐέμπτωτον εἷς νόσον, οὕτω γὰρ ὠνόμασεν ὁ Ποσειδώνιος, ἦ
αὐτῇ τῇ νόσῳ, εἶναι γὰρ ἤτοι νοσώδη τινὰ ἕξιν ἦ ἤδη νοσοῦσαν. Cicero adopts
the Chrysippean parallelism of morbus corporis to morbus animi in such
a way as to ignore the criticism by making no attempt to avoid it. Further
the definition of sanitas animi given in 13, 30 f. is in exact accord with
the views of Chrysippus as criticized by Galen following Posidonius (op. cit.
pp. 416ff. M. [pp. 440 ff. K..]) Chrysippus had said διὸ καὶ καλὴ ἢ αἰσχρὰ
ψυχὴ ἀνάλογον ῥηθήσεται κατὰ συμμετρίαν τε τινα καὶ α’συμμετρίαν τοιῶνδε
τινῶν μερῶν, in which Posidonius scented a contradiction lurking in the
word μέρη; which however it seems from a later passage (p. 422) was used
by Chrysippus in conformity with his view that the λόγος was ἐννοιῶν τε
τινῶν καὶ προλήψεων ἄθροισμα; this corresponds precisely to Cicero's
iudicia opinionesque concordant.

There is therefore no ground for assuming any except a Chrysippean
source for these chapters.

With c. 15 Cicero begins the more rhetorical treatment of his subject
in which, though still adhering to the Stoic position in principle, he
allows himself to “spread his sails.'' His definition of virtue in 15, 34
is Stoic as is the definition of perturbationes in the same paragraph. The
substance of 16, 36 repeats iii 8, 16 f. and the praemeditatio recommended
in 17, 37 f. is τὸ προενδημεῖν of Chrysippus. There follows (17, 38) a
criticism of the Peripatetic view of the mean, which extends with
digressions to the end of c. 26. In it the Stoic standpoint is defended
against the criticisms alike of the Peripatetics and the New Academy
(21, 473 24, 53). The comparison in 18, 41 f. of a man under the in-
fluence of a πάθος to a man falling from a precipice or standing upon a
slope is also derived from Chrysippus, who is quoted by Galen (op. cit.
p. 360 M. [p. 388 K.]) for the sentence: οἶδὲ κατὰ τὸν λόγον κινούμενοι ὦς ἂν
ἡγεμόνα καὶ τούτῳ οἷακίζοντες τὰς κατὰ μέρος δηλονότι κινήσεις τῆς ψυχῆς
κρατοῦσι τῶν κατὰ αὐτὰς ὁρμῶν ἀνάλογον τοῖς περιπατοῦσι ἀλλ’ οὐχ ὑπὸ
αὐτῶν ἐκφέρονται βιαίως ὥσπερ οἱ κατὰ πρανοῦς θέοντες. Here again Cicero
ignores the criticisms of Posidonius, who, as reported by Galen, pointed
out that the inability to stop when running down a slope was due to
causes outside the person concerned‚ and that in the case of the mind
such a comparison‚ if relevant, implied that other than purely rational
causes must be postulated. According to him, then, the comparison was
in Chrysippus' mouth inept and inconsistent with his psychological
assumptions. This is ignored by Cicero in a way which seems unlikely if
