reason. Not only is the contradiction between this general position and
the subsequent definitions formal and complete, but it is hard to see why
the statement should have been introduced at all, and if introduced why
it should not have been made earlier. If the general distinction between
the irrational soul, the source of the perturbationes, and the rational soul,
the seat of the controlling influence, was relevant in any way to Cicero's
discussion, the. place to draw it was when he began the treatment of the
most obstinate of the perturbationes in the third book. It is not even
hinted at there: why then is it introduced here?

This casual and careless method of dealing with fundamental questions
renders it very difficult to avoid the conclusion that if Cicero really held
to the Platonic psychology (as he says he did) he either did not under-
stand, or considered irrelevant for his purpose, the distinction between
the Stoic and the Platonic view of the emotions. If he had read
Posidonius' criticisms of Chrysippus (upon which there is no direct
evidence either positive or negative) he cannot have failed to understand
the difference or have regarded it as psychologically unimportant. But
his immediate object being not scientific but practical, he seems to have
put the question to one side, content to assume that the practical results
could be reached independently of theoretical presuppositions. That the
Stoic definitions could not be accepted as they stood by any adherent of
the Platonic psychology ought to have been sels—evident; that the
Peripatetic doctrine of the mediocritates, so vigorously repudiated by
Cicero, is not easily to be set aside if the Platonic psychology be
admitted, does not seem to have been considered by him with sufficient
care: and he may have been the more readily induced to gloss over
distinctions by the ease with which words may be chosen to conceal them.
It is not hard to see how (eg.) the definition ‘auersa α recta ratione
contra naturam animi commotz'o' might be interpreted and applied by
a Platonist: how “adpetitiones animi '’ might be held to be either the
ὁρμαί of Chrysippus or τὸ ἐπιθυμητικόν of Posidonius. Expressions seem
to slip in which it is difficult to interpret from a purely Stoic standpoint.
How are we to reconcile with pure Stoicism the phrase in 2 5, 55 ‘utile
est enim uti motu animi qui uti ratione non potest '?

For this and similar inconsistencies of expression Cicero might have
pleaded the example of Chrysippus himself, who, as Galen (De plac. Hipp.
et Plat. p. 331 M. (362 K.) ff.) points out, was in the habit at least of
accommodating his language to the conceptions of a Platonist if not, as
Galen believes, of actually contradicting himself. One might even go the
length of conjecturing that Cicero's apparent indifference to important
doctrinal distinctions may have been encouraged by Chrysippus' indif-
ference to the importance of verbal consistency.
