xxxviii INTROD UCTION

the consideration that it was not magnum malum. To this Cicero raises
two objections: (1) that it is a method only suitable in the case of a
sapiens, ‘qui consolatione non eget‚' and (2) that it cannot be employed
in the case of a person whose grief is due to the fact that he is not
virtuous or wise. The first objection is at bottom identical with the
view of Chrysippus. Galen (op. cit. p. 371 M. [p. 398 K.]) quotes
from Posidonius the clause εἴτε πρὸς τῷ μεγέθει τῶν φαινομένων καὶ
τὴν ἀσθένειαν τῆς ψυχῆς αἰτιάσονται καὶ διὰ τοῦτο τούς μὲν σοφοὺς τὸ
παράπαν ἐροῦσιν ἀπηλλάχθαι τῶν παθῶν κτλ., in Which, as the context
shows, the arguments of Chrysippus and his followers are under
discussion. The second objection will be more conveniently discussed
when we corne to consider the arguments that are to be mentioned
under (e).

(d) The method of dealing with aegritudo which consists in the
explanation that it is merely an opinio et iudicium magni praesentis atque
urgentis mali (25, 61), though separately discussed and briefly dismissed
by Cicero, is really identical with (c).

(e) The view, variously expressed by Cicero, that a satisfactory cure
or consolatio can be secured by the reflexion that, whatever be the object
which has caused the aegritudo, grief is useless and unnecessary and not
a matter of duty, is expressly attributed to Chrysippus in 31, 76 and
adopted by Cicero (33, 793 34, 82) as on the whole the most satisfactory,
though the practical application of it may cause difficulty when the
emotion is still fresh and strong. It affords the only satisfactory reply
to the objection urged by Posidonius, that if an emotion be a δόξα that
the object which arouses it is very good or very bad then οἱ προκόπ-
τοντες must be in a perpetual state of mental disturbance: the sight of
the virtue which they hope to attain and of the evil which they desire
to avoid, giving rise to an opinion of their nature which cannot be
refuted, must fill them either with unseemly desire or unseemly grief.
So far as the actual fragments of Chrysippus go there is no direct
evidence that he raised or considered the point, while we know from
Galen that Posidonius made much of it (op. cit. p. 370 M. [p. 397 K.]).
But the general trend of the views of Chrysippus as well as particular
expressions in his extant fragments leave little doubt both that he raised
the question and answered it by the argument which Cicero lays such
stress upon (see Hirzel op. cit. iii pp. 436 sqq: Pohlenz Heck. Jahrb.
xx1v pp. 569, 613). If this be so it must be assumed that the discussion
of this point in 28, 68 is derived not from Posidonius (who solved the
difficulty by the argument that in the persons concerned the rational
faculty was so powerful as to keep the emotions in check) but, either
mediately or immediately, from Chrysippus.
