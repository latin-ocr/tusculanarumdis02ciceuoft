—18. 41] LIBER QVARTVS 145

P. Rupilium fratris repulsam consulatus scriptum apud Fannium
est. sed tamen transisse uidetur modum, quippe qui ob eam
causam a uita recesserit; moderatius igitur ferre debuit. quid, si,
35 cum id ferret modice, mors liberorum accessisset? nata esset
aegritudo noua. sed ea modica. magna tamen facta esset acces-
sio. quid, si deinde dolores graues corporis, si bonorum amissio,
si caecitas, si exsilium? si pro singulis malis aegritudines acce-

derent, summa ea fieret quae non sustineretur.
XVIII. 41. Qui modum igitur uitio quaerit, similiter facit,
ut si posse putet eum qui se e Leucata praecipitauerit sustinere

1². Rupilium: i.e. P. Rupilius Lupus,
cons. 132 B.c.; Plin. N.H. vii 36 ‘P.
Rupilius morbo leui impeditus nuntiata
fratris repulsa in consulatus petitione ilico
exspirauit.’ The date of his death falls
between 132 and 129, the date of the
death of Scipio, who assisted his brother's
candidature. His brother was Lucius Ru·
pilius, praetor in 147 B.C. The brothers
were both proteges of Scipio Aemilianus,
Lael. 20, 73.

Fannium: i.e. C. Fannius, the his-
torian, son-in-law of C. Laelius and
pupil of Panaetius3 he was trib. pleb.
in 142, praetor between 129 and 125 and
consul in 122. Cic. makes the curious
mistake in Brut. 26, 99 of supposing that
the consul os 122 and the historian were
two different people, a mistake perhaps
corrected at the time by Atticus (Att. xii
5, 3) and demonstrated by Mommsen
(C.J.L. i p. 158). The fragments of his
history are collected by Peter (Hist. Rom.
rell. 1 pp. 138—140).

uidetur: the sarcastic tone of this
passage is further heightened by the sug-
gestion of a dialogue between Cicero and
a Peripatetic which seems to underlie it.

id. :fratris repulsam.

sed ea modica: the supposed retort of
the Peripatetic‚ with whom the question
is being argued: for the rare use of sed
in place of at in a retort see Draeger,
Syntax 11 ἓ 333, 33 Bentley⁷s conj. sz't
for sed has been adopted by Dav. Hei.

H.

accessio, ‘a serious aggravation of his
trouble '; cf. Fin. i 17, 55 ‘ut enim
aeque doleamus, cum corpore dolemus,
fieri tamen permagna accessio potest si...’:
accessio is a word much used by medical
writers to denote the onset of a disease
eg. fever; cf. Seneca, de benef. ii 14, 3
‘cum accessio illa quae animum inflam-
mabat remiserit.'

summa, ‘the final result would be
such as to be intolerable’; for summa cf.
Off. i 18, 59 ‘uidere quae reliqui summa
fiat’3 Fin. iv 24, 67 ‘ad uirtutis autem
summam accedere nihil potest.’

XVIII. §41. uitio: Reid (Ac. ii 7,
19 n.) thinks that uiti should be read
here as ‘with fidem facere, modum f.,
finem f. and many similar expressions,
the overwhelmingly prevalent construc-
tion in the best writers is alicuius rei not
alicui rei': he cites also 38, 82 ‘sit iam
huius disputationis modus.’ A much
closer apparent parallel is to be found in
ἓ 40 ‘quaeramus enim modum aegritudi-
nis.' But there seems to be a clear dis-
tinction between the two uses: quaerere
m. aegritudinis means ‘to be in quest of
the mean in aegritudo' : a purely theoreti-
cal search, whereas qu. m. aegritudini:
‘ a practical endeavour to regulate feeling. ³
The latter seems to be required by the
context here, the former in ἓ 40.

similiter...ut si: this use of ut sz' is
rare before Cicero: it is found after
simililer (Off. i 25, 87), similis (Senect.
6, 17), idem (Offli 14, 4²) ; in Fin. ii 7,
213 iv 12, 31 Madv. reads et sz' after
similiter and similem respectively. For
further exx. see Draeger, Synt. 11 ἓ 518, 2.
