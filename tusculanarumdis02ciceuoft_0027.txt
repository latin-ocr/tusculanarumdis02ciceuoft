Here the proper course is either to show (a) the trivia] character of
the pleasure aimed at, or (b) to inspire the lover with other interests‚ or
(c) to get rid of one passion by means of another, or (d) to show that the
passion is really insane and disgusfing, and in any case a voluntary and
not a necessary affection, §g 75, 76.

Anger is still more clearly a form of insanity3 here the patient is to
be treated by the withdrawal of the object of his anger, or by being
induced to defer its satisfaction, as Archytas voluntarily did, ἐξ 77, 78.
How absurd then is the view that anger is either natural or useful! If the
former, all men would be equally angry, and no one need ever repent
of its results as did Alexander : like other emotions it is purely voluntary
and proceeds from a false estimate of the value of objects 3 like other
emotions it may be enred, and it is true of it as of the others that some
men are naturally prone to it, and if it be not checked in time it becomes
incurable, ἐξ, 79-81.

EPILOGUE. The four days' discussion has shown that next to the
knowledge of final good and ill there is nothing more useful than the
discussion of such subJects. It has been shown (a) that death, and
(b) that pain are to be despised and endured‚ (c) that annoyance, and
(d) that all emotions are evil and can be cured. Annoyance is perhaps
worse than the others and so has been treated in a separate book 3 but
they are all effects of wrong judgment and can be cured, nor while they
remain uncured can we be really happy or of sound mind, §g 82-4.

Introduction, ἐξ 1-11.

The consideration of the fifth day's subject, the self-sufficiency of
virtue to ensure happiness, must end the discussions3 this thesis,

though difficult to prove, is the most important message of philosophy 3
the desire to secure happiness gave rise to philosophical speculation, and
