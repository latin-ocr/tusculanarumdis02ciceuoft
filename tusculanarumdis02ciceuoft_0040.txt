xxxiv INTRODUCTION

however admits the difficulty of coming to a definite conclusion in
regard to many phrases, as Cicero evidently made an attempt to cover
up the fact that his sources were at variance on important points.

The two principal philosophical questions discussed in the book are
(a) the nature of the perturbatio (πάθος) known as aegritudo (λύπη) and
(b) the proper‘method of its treatment. Cicero defines aegritudo in 11,
25 as ‘opinio magni mali praesentis, et quidem recens opinio talis mali
ut in eo rectum uideatur esse angi.' This definition must be interpreted
however in the light of the general definition of perturbatio given in the
preceding paragraph, ‘animi motus uel rationis expers uel rationem
aspernans uel rationi non oboediens, isque motus aut boni aut mali
opinione citetur.' According to this general definition a perturbatio is
a motus animi which takes its rise in an opinio: while according to the
special definition of aegritudo this particular perturbatio is an opinio.
This apparent looseness or inconsistency of expression is characteristic
of the whole book: it is one thing to say of perturbationes that ‘causa
omnis in opinione est‚' it is another to say that every perturbatio is an
opim'o3 and yet the expressions are used interchangeably by Cicero:
examples of the former are to be found in 12, 26 (where ‘in opinione
mali’ must be interpreted by ‘tumor animi' preceding, though in 28, 71
in opinione is used in a context which belongs to the other definition);
29, 72 ‘sed plures sunt causae susezpiendi doloris. primum illa opinio
mali, quo uiso atque persuaso aegritudo insequitur necessario': examples
of the latter are 2 5, 61 ‘est enim nulla alia (sc. aegritudo) nisi opinio et
iudicium magni praesentz's...mali’,· 26, 62 3 28, 683 31, 74 ‘satis dictum
esse arbitror aegritudinem esse opinionem mali praesentis¹ .· in the case
of other passages such as 13, 28 ‘tum aegritudinem existere, cum quid
ita uisum sit, ut magnum quoddam malum adesse...uz'deatur’ and 34,
82 ‘aegritudinem omnem procul abesse a sapiente, quod... non natura
exoriatur, sed iudicio, sed opinione' it is somewhat difficult to say under
which head they should be classed. This looseness of expression is all
the more remarkable when we remember that it relates to a point which
was the subject of a historic difference of opinion between Zeno and
Chrysippus, who are both referred to by Cicero as being responsible for
the views he expounds without any indication of their opinions having
differed: in fact Zeno is quoted with commendation in 31, 75 as the
author of an addition to a definition which, according to Galen, was
framed not by him but by his critic Chrysippus. With regard to the
general difference of opinion Galen says (de placitis Hippocratis et
Platonis p. 405 M. [p. 429 K.]) Χρύσιππος μὲν οὖν ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ περὶ
παθῶν ἀποδεικνύναι πειρᾶται κρίσεις τινὰς εἶναι τοῦ λογιστικοῦ τὰ πάθη,
