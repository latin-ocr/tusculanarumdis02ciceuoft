if happiness is to be secured by philosophy, who would not be a philo-
sopher? If virtue cannot secure happiness amid the accidents of fortune
we must despair, as Cicero confesses he sometimes does himself, of ever
attaining it. Our bodies are so subject to disease and pain that one
sometimes fears the mind must necessarily be subject to a similar
fortune ; this fear proceeds from a distrust of the power of virtue, which
can raise us above all accidents of life and fate, by giving us true views
of the world, {3 1-4.

Philosophy alone can correct our mistaken views and ensure our
happiness. Cicero breaks into an impassioned apostrophe of the philo-
sophy which has created society, literature and civilization 3 whose pre-
cepts make a moment of time more precious than immortality 3 which
has destroyed the fear of death. But in spite of such services to man,
it is not merely neglected but despised and its history forgotten.

Though the word philosophy is new, the subjects it deals with are
old: the Seven Wise Men, Lycurgus and others were philosophers in
fact though not in name, the name being coined by Pythagoras who
considered the contemplation of nature the most liberal pursuit‚ and the
knowledge of it the most precious possession: he advanced the study
of science and applied it in the public and private life of Magna Graecia.
Until Socrates philosophers studied merely geometry, arithmetic,
physics, astronomy 3 Socrates was the first to study moral science 3 his
dialectical skill and intellectual power can be seen in the dialogues of
Plato3 he was the real founder of the Academic method, of which
Carneades was the most celebrated exponent, to which Cicero will
adhere in this discussion—the method of suspension of judgment and
refusal to dogmatize‚ §g 7—11.

The theme for discussion, gg 12-14.

The proposition is laid down by one of the company that virtue is
not sufficient to ensure a life of happiness. From this Cicero strongly
dissents 3 he asserts that virtue is sufficient to ensure a life of goodness,
rectitude‚ and honour and that such a life is a happy life. His opponent
retorts that a man may live such a life and yet be unhappy, if for
example he is subjected to torture. Cicero refuses to believe that
happiness will not unite itself to the company of the virtues even though
they be in the hands of the torturer. The reply of his opponent is a
refusal to be put off with Stoic figures of speech 3 he demands that
leaving abstractions aside Cicero should deal with the facts of life and
with the dictates of common sense which declares that pain and happiness
are incompatible. This Cicero promises to do though denying the right of
his opponent to prescribe the method of proof to be adopted, §g 12—14.
