PREFACE

HEN on the death of the late Professor Dougan his
papers were examined it was found that the second

volume of his edition of Cicero's Tusculan Dz'sputations, upon
which he had been engaged up to the last, was in a very in-
complete condition. He had left a fair copy of the explanatory
notes upon Book ΙΙΙ and the first 34 paragraphs of Book IV,
and there were several notebooks containing his collations of
various MSS. His widow (now Mrs Bor), to whom he entrusted
the task of seeing that the book should be completed, and his
executor, Mr William Dougan, handed these over to the present
editor with the request that he should finish the work. The
editor has accordingly printed as it stood that portion of the
commentary which had been finished before Professor Dougan's
death, adding only a few notes of his own enclosed in square
brackets, and has himself written the commentary upon the
remainder of Book IV and the whole of Book V, together with
the Introduction containing a detailed analysis of the three
books and a discussion of the question of Cicero’s sources
Deciding to keep the critical notes uniform with those of the
first volume, he used Professor Dougan’s collations as far as
they went, but collated himself for this volume the following
MSS‚E1 E2R1 R6R7R10R16R17Vand P.

To the list (vol. I, p. ix) of editions consulted should be added
for this volume that of L. W. Hasper (Gotha‚ 1883—5) (Ha.)

The editor desires to record his sincere thanks to the Syndics
of the Press for their kindness in undertaking the publication of
this volume and for their great patience in the long delay that
has occurred in the completion of the work. He must also thank
the readers of the press for the care and skill which detected
errors that but for them might have passed unnoticed; and his
friend Professor R. K. McElderry for his kindness in reading
the proofs of the text and commentary.
