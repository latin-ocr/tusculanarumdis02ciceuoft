optimo uitae statu exquirendo conlocarent, profecto spe beate
uiuendi tantam in eo studio curam operamque posuerunt. quodsi
ab iis inuenta et perfecta uirtus est, et si praesidii ad beate

philosophiae studium contulerunt' are
not the early physicists‚ as this would
make ‘totos se in optimo uitae statu ex-
quirendo conlocarent' hopelessly unhis-
torical (a blunder which Hei. is content
to attribute to a lapse of memory on
Cicero's part), nor Socrates and his
followers (Kuh.)‚ which would involve an
equally serious lapse in primi, but the
σοφοί ‘a quibus uita hominum instructa
primis sit’ (ἓ 6) and the others men-
tioned in ἐξ 7 sq.; the optimus uitae
status will then have a meaning primarily
political and social, not ethical.

Sff„ while rightly rejecting Bentley⁷s
alf'qua for ea as palaeographicallyunlikely‚
arid Bake’ s nam quaecumque causa as bad
grammar with compulerzsst proposes to
omit ea as a dittography of the ca in

causa. But as his object is to get rid of

the historical difficulty in the interpreta-
tion οἱ the words qm· primi..samaeas-ent,
a difficulty which does not exist if the
passage be interpreted (as above) in view
of ἐξ 6 and 7, the emendation becomes
unnecessary; his proposal further in-
volves the awkwardness of taking the
clause ut...conlacarent as limiting the
application of primi se contulerunt in
the preceding clause, a case in which
Cic. would almost certainly have used
z'ta...ut.

Transl. ‘For since the motive impel-
ling those who first devoted themselves
to the study of philosophy was such that
...they gave their whole attention to the
discovery os the ideal state of existence,
it must certainly have been from the ex-
pectation of a happy life that they devoted
so much care and attention to the pursuit
of it.'

inuenta et perfecta, ‘ discovered and
elaborated‚ thoroughly discussed’3 for
this use of perficere cf. 25, 72 ‘sequentia
adiungit, perfecta concludit’; iv 5, 9
‘erit enim hoc totum, quod quaero, ex
utroque perfectius' (⁴ more thoroughly
(liscussed'3) Legg. i 13, 35; Diu. ii 1, 3
‘quae (se. quaestio) ut plane esset cumu-
lateque perfecta.’ Generally pmflcta, when
applied to uzrtus, means‘ thoroughly per-
formed‚⁷ e.g. pro Sest. 40, 86‘ et sentire
uero et facere perfectae cumulataeque
uirtutis'; cf. Off. iii 3, 14 ‘illud autem
officium, quod rectum idem appellant,
perfectum atque absolutum est.' Cicero
seems fond of contrasting inuenire and
perficere, e.g. de Or. i4, 13 Athenas, in
quibus summa dicendi uis et inuenta est
et perfecta'3 Brut. 18, 71 ‘nihilest enim
simul et inuentum et perfectum)

positam: used here to recall operamque

posuerunt above : Nissen strangely takes

it as equivalent to depositam forming a
contrast with susceptam.

subiecta, ‘brought under the power
of': Madv. in his n. on Fin. ii 15, 48
shows that subicere is followed either by
the dative, as in Off. ii 6, ππ pro domo
40, 106; or by sub with the acc. as here,
and in iv 7, 16; iv 8, 192 Ac. ii 23, 74.

tantarum uirium : Mo. notes that
the gen. plur. is more rarely used in this
constr. than the abl. plur.; he quotes
Plin. N. H. vii 2 ‘gens.. stridoris horrendi,
