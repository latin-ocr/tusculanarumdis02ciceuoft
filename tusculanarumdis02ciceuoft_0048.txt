familiar to Cicero and if he had for his Consolatio read, as he says he did
(Att. xii 14, 3), everything that had been written on the subject, it is idle
to assume that a passage in which (eg.) a fragment of Euripides occurs
must have been borrowed from (say) Crantor merely because we know
that Crantor quoted that particular fragment, and have no direct evidence
that any other writer on the same subject either did or did not.

Cicero quotes (or professes to quote) the following Greek authors in
this book: Crantor (6, 1 2), Dionysius (9, 18), Theophrastus (10, 2 1), Zeno
the Epicurean (17, 38), Epicurus (18, 41 f.; 20, 46), Chrysippus (22, 52,
25, 61 (?); 31, 76), Clitomachus (22, 54), Antiochus (25, 59), Aristotle
(28, 69), Cleanthes (31, 76 (?))‚ Lycon (32, 78). It is not necessary to
assume that all these quotations are at first hand: but it seems like
trifling with evidence to assert that this was not so in the cases of Crantor,
Epicurus, Chrysippus, Clitomachus and Antiochus: while Zeno is quoted
from Cicero’s recollections of lectures which he attended at Athens.

On the whole it seems most probable that Cicero followed in the
main in this book the doctrines of Chrysippus on the origin of aegritudo
and the method of its cure,¹ that he relied for his knowledge upon his
own acquaintance with the works of Chrysippus and (perhaps) other
writers of the Chrysippean school 3 that he made extensive use of the
works of other authors whom he had read for the purposes of his Conso-
latio (e.g. Crantor and Clitomachus) , that he introduced, when necessary,
recollections of his reading of other authors both Greek (eg. Panaetius)
and Latin, and that in arranging his materials he was guided by his own
judgment and fancy.

BOOK IV.

The subject which was begun in Book iii is continued in Book iv,
which deals with the remaining perturbationes and their cure. Hirzel op.
cit. iii pp. 456 ff. thinks that it is therefore to be referred to the same
source: we have, he argues, the same sceptical tone which is against the
assumption of a dogmatic source, and the polemic against the Peripatetics
which excludes Antiochus ,· Posidonius is excluded since Cicero adopts
the views of Chrysippus which Posidonius combatted as to the parallelism
between mental and bodily diseases. He concludes that Philo is the
source. Pohlenz l.c. pp. 339 ff. argues that the subdivision of the πάθη,
the polemic against the Peripatetics, the method advocated for curing
the πάθη, all point to an orthodox Stoic source. This is most probably
some work of Chrysippus, and perhaps the Θεραπευτικός.
