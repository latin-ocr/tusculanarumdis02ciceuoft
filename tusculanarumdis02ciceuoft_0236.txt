einerseits die Dinge, welche F'ureht oder
Kumrner einflbssen, keine Uebel‚ anderer-
scits die Dioge, welche Begierde oder
Frohlichkeit erregen, keine Guter sind,
dennoch die Gemiithsbewegung an und
fur sich fehlerhaft ist⁷ ; i.e. even suppos-
ing the Stoic view to be true yet pertur-
bation is undesirable. As this, the only
natural meaning of the Latin words, is
the precise opposite of what Cicero
might be expected to say in the context,
most edd. follow Bent. and Lamb. in
altering the negative to the positive: Bent.
followed by Ml. Sff. Hei. T.S. Schiche
reading uel...uel in place of nec...nec,
and Lamb. followed by Fabr. F.A.W.
Schz. et...et: the meaning will then be
‘ even if the objects which give rise to sear
or vexation are evils and those which
arouse desire or delight are goods yet
mental perturbation is in itself undesir—
ables i.e. even adopting a view which at
first sight might seem to justify pertur-
batio if anything could, philosophers
would yet be agreed that it was in itself
vicious. A superficial support is lent to
this view by the fact that Cic. has him-
self earlier in the § adduced a case of
aegritudo which required to be cured
although the aegritudo was propter mala.

The objection which may be made to
all the explanations proposed above is
that they do not take sufficiently into
account first, that the clause ut. etiamsi...
...ipsa commotio is the statement (not of
a fact or a conclusion but) of a point of
view to be adopted by agreement among
all philosophers; and secondly that the
parties to the agreement adopt a common
attitude upon one point, etiam de ceteris
rebus discrepantes. This point of agree-
ment is uz'tiosam esse ipsam commotionem ;
differences are allowed upon the ques-
tions to which the words etiamsi. . .moueant
refer. Yet both those who read et...et (or
uel...uel) and those who read nec...nec
make the sentence contemplate some one
definite point of view (whether that of the
Stoics or their opponents) as adopted on
these other points as a part of the general
agreement.

The clause beginning z'nteromnes enim

spernentem corr. m‘r doctus

planatory of the preceding talis quidem...
plzz‘losoplzorzmz and Cicero's habit of taking
up and developing his own statements in
detail makes one expect some clause
explanatory of, or expanding, the phrase
etiam de celeris rebus discrepantium ς this
clause can only be etiamsz'...moueant and
must of course not contradict de ceteris
rebus discrepantium in meaning.

These conditions are satisfied by read·
ing etiam sz' nec malane sint illa...nec
bona quae...moueant‚ understanding con-
ueniat from conuenire in the preceding
clause. Trans. ‘ There should be, 1 mean,
a general agreement that emotions opposed
to right reason are morbid states, so that
if there should not be any agreement
whether those things which excite fear
and vexation are evils or not, or those
things good which excite desire and
delight, still perturbation is in itself a
morbid state.' This is supported by the
resume in the next paragraph, where ut
m'lzil quale sit illud quod perturbet
animum [docendum sit] answers to the
clause etiamsi.. ‚moueant here.

spernentem, an anonymous conjecture
for the MSS prementem mentioned (to
be rejected) by Lamb. but approved by
Bent. and adopted by Mo. Bai. Wes.
Ml. TS. Hei. The MSS reading is kept
by Lamb. Dav. Or. Ktih. Kl. and de-
fended by Wopkens (op. cit. p. 138) and
Hand. Bouh. conjectured ferentem.

Dav. wrshed to give to prementem the
sense of calcantem, a meaning which Bent.
showed was only possible if pedibus or
some similar word was expressed. Pre-
mere can be used with words denoting
feeling, in the sense of ‘ repress,’ ‘control’
(Seneca, de Ira iii 6, 1 (quoted by Wop-
kens); Stat. Theb. 9, 5463 Val. Fl. iii
370 etc.)‚ a meaning which is impossible
here as humana cannot mean ‘human
feeling5'; nor is it possible to get a
satisfactory meaning out of the sense
noted by Hand ‘premere dicitur de omni-
bus rebus quae ne exsurgant aut euagentur
moderatione et temperatione cohibentur,‘
since the wise man has no control over
the accidents of fortune. In silver age
