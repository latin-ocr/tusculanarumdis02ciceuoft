[NTRODUCTION xxxix

(f) The attempt to cure aegritudo by adducing examples of persons
who have suffered already may be regarded from one point of view as a
subdivision of praemeditatio. If, however, the method be employed
without regard to the circumstances of the particular case it may do
more harm than good (33, 79). There is nothing here which is incon-
sistent with the general standpoint adopted in the book.

It remains to discuss in detail the method adopted by Cicero and to
endeavour to discover whether any particular treatise or author can be
shown to be the source probably followed in the dialogue. The intro-
duction (gg 1-7) is admitted on all hands to be Cicero's own 3 but it is
important to keep in mind that the view adopted in ἓ 2 of the origin of
human depravity can hardly be reconciled with any psychological
doctrine other than that professed by the strict Stoic. The corruption
of human nature is there referred entirely to the environment and up-
bringing of human beings: it is mali mores opinionesque (imbibed from
nurses, parents, schools, literature and life) which quench the original
sparks of virtue: there is not a word about the irrational faculties‚ τὸ
θυμοειδές and τὸ ἐπιθυμητικόν, the traitors within the soul, upon which
Posidonius laid so much stress. In fact no two views of the matter
could well be more inconsistent than that expounded by Cicero here and
that attributed to Posidonius in Galen op. cit. p. 465 M. [p. 483 K.].
The general parallelism between diseases of the body and those of the
soul, though in some points of detail differently expressed by Posidonius
and Chrysippus, is too vaguely sketched in Cicero to afford a satisfactory
clue to his sympathies in this minor discussion.

The subject of the dialogue is stated and expounded in 4, 7—6‚ 13.
Here the material which can be directly referred to any Greek source is
no more than the text upon which Cicero dilates: the digressions upon
points of translation and etymology are Cicero's addition and they are
so worked in with the rest that the result owes more to Cicero than to
any probable source. The definition of πάθη as ‘motus animi rationi
non obtemperantes’ is one to which, it is true, Posidonius might have
subscribed if he had been allowed to interpret ratio as τὸ λογιστικόν and
animus as the whole which comprised both it and the irrational elements
of τὸ θυμοειδές and τὸ ἐπιθυμητικόν. But Chrysippus also used such phrases
as ἄλογος and ἀπειθὲς λόγῳ and ἀπεστραμμένον τοῦ λόγου, for which (and
especially in the case of ἄλογος) he was charged with an unscientific
ambiguity (Galen op. cit. pp. 348 ff. M. [pp. 377 ff. K.]). The quotation
from Crantor in 6, 1 2 is probably derived from the materials amassed for
the Consolatio, in which Cicero had collected the views of all philosophers
who had written upon the subject. The passage is in any ease only quoted
to be refuted and Crantor's general position was one which both here and
