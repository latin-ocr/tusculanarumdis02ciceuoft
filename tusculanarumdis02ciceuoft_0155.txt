writes ‘sane necessarium non est, cum
eius significatio insit in ipso v. consolantis,
consolatio enim sine doctrina aliqua prae-
beri nequit.’ The fact is that any idea
that is to be carried on to the clause
malum illud omnino non esse must be
found in officium, not in consolantis. If
we had had sunt qui unam consolationem

putent the ellipse would have been pos-

sible with the verbal but, even where we
actually have the verbal in 32, 77 erit
egitur in consolationibus prima medicina,
we have docere expressed in the text. No
real parallel for such an ellipse as the
MS reading presents can be found. Those
put forward by K'uh. are inadequate:
docere is not supplied to the third clause
in 32, 77, but' is carried on from the first
clause, just quoted above. In 15, 31
dicens is easily supplied from praedicare
and in iv 38, Η83, sed et aearz'tua'zm's et
reliquorum ani'mz morborum una sanatio
est, omnes opinabiles esse. ‚ una sanatio
est is nearly=una sanandi doctrina est
and the idea required flows smoothly
from the verbal. Dav. wrongly altered ut
Peripatetici of the MSS to ut Peripateticis
below, but his suggestion that the true
reading may be sunt qui unum offi‘cium
consolantis putant malum illud omnino
non esse, ut Cleanthes, persuadere is worth
recording.

ut Cleanthi placet: we have no res. to
show why this view is specially attributed
to Cleanthes. This passage is not illustra-
ted by ii 25, 60 to which Hei. and T. S.
refer, for there the view of Cleanthes is
that held by Zeno before him. Cleanthes
must have specially employed this view
sor consolation or some similar purpose
and hence been quoted by Cicero’ s source.
He wrote a Προτρεπτικός Diog. L. vii 5,
175 which is probably referred to in Diog.

ut Peripatetici: sc. putant. F or the
change from itt Cleantlziplacet cf. Ac. ii
39, 124 ‘ut Platoni placuit...ut Xeno-
crates.’ For the Peripatetic view cf. ii 27,
66 n. on ‘aut...tantu1um.’

ut Epicurus: cf. 15, 33.

nihil inopinati: for this Cyrenaic view
cf. 13, 28; 22, 52.

ut Aristippus: nz'lzz'l mali must be a
gloss upon nihil inopinati, cf. Wes. Em.
1 p. 10. Dav. rightly argues that, as we
have an authority cited for each of the
preceding three views, we must have an.
authority mentioned for this view and he
inserts ut Cyrenaici. Or.‚ in notes to
F .A.W.⁷s notes, suggested ut Aristippus
which seems better, as Aristippus might
easily be missed by a copyist before
Chrysippus.

Chrysippus autem...2 this passage
shows that in the Stoic definition of
aegritudo we have an addition introduced
by Chrysippus in the words in 11, 25
‘talis mali, ut in eo rectum uideatur esse
angi’3 26, 62 ‘oportere, rectum esse, ad
officium pertinere⁷3 iv 7, 14 ‘in quo
demitti contrahique animo rectum esse
uideatur.' This is also indicated by the
words with which Posidonius assails
Chrysippus' view in Galen op. cit. iv p.370

best MSS, omitted these words but Wes.
