INTRODUCTION xix

Resides no limit is possible. One may under a single misfortune give
way to emotion, and if misfortune be repeated the emotion will increase
till it passes all bounds, ᾗ 39, 40. To try to set a limit to what is in itself
a uitium is to try to stop oneself in mid air after leaping from a cliff ;
a mind once upon the downward track will go on 3 the disease will
increase 3 without reason the mind has no strength3 it is no protection
against vice to be moderately vicious, §g 41, 42.

Besides the Peripatetics declare the emotions to possess a certain
utility ς (α) anger, for instance, whets the courage of warriors and inspires
orators 5 a man who cannot be angry is no man; (b) Themistocles was
roused to energy by jealousy of Miltiades, (c) even philosophers have
agreed for knowledge 3 (d) annoyance has its moral uses when nien are
annoyed at their own faults—and so they argue about (e) pity, envy, sear
and all the rest, of which they approve in moderation, ἐξ 41—46.

Cicero is not going to join in the bout of sparring between the
Peripatetics and the Stoics, the only question being for an impartial
enquirer “What is the true definition of perturbatz·0?” Can a better
than that of Zeno be found, “an unnatural movement of the mind away
from right reason ''? Cicero now takes the Peripatetics up point by point:
(α) Anger: to say that a man cannot be brave unless he is angry is to
degrade a brave man to the level of the gladiator in Lucilius. Was not
Ajax joyful instead of angry when he challenged Hector, as is apparent
from their colloquy before their duel? The bravery of Torquatus,
Marcellus, Africanus, Hercules borrowed nothing from anger. Bravery
is the deliberate judgment of the mind that death and pain are to be
despised and endured: anger is a kind of madness, as much akin to
valour as is drunkenness. The definitions of bravery given by Sphaerus
and Chrysippus support this view (the Stoics are right when they say that
all but the wise are mad). Again, anger can hardly be said to be of use
in domestic life. It is true that an orator or a poet may simulate anger,
but that is a different thing3 (b) Greed: to say that philosophers are
greedy for knowledge is an abuse of language 3 (c) A nnoyance: the moral
uses of annoyance have nothing to do with a wise man 3 (d) Pity,
jealousy and the rest are similarly useless ; a wise man should help, not
pity‚ and there is little utility in envy and jealousy, ᾗ 47- 56.

If a man has any of these vices even to a slight degree he is so far to
be blamed, and cannot be called a wise man, the only safe remedy is
not to prune but to eradicate, S 57.

C. The treatment of the emotions, §g 58-81.

Cicero is not sure that the friend who laid down the general
proposition of ἓ 8 may not, under the guise of an abstract discussion,
