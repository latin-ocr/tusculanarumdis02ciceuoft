xxxvi INTRODUCTJON

different passages or to the use of an authority who attempted to corn-
bine both views.

The views of both Zeno and Chrysippus were subjected to a pene—
trating examination by Posidonius, who, as the result, probably, of
Academic criticism, abandoned the traditional Stoic psychology and
adopted the Platonic threefold division of the soul into τὸ λογικόν, τὸ
θυμοειδές and τὸ ἐπιθυμητικόν. His view of the emotions (expounded by
Galen in books iv and v of the De placitis Hippocratis et Platonis) is thus
radically distinct from that adopted by Cicero in T.D. iii. Regarding the
emotions as due to the irrational elements of the soul, he could not of
course subscribe to any definition which regarded them as originating in,
or being identical with, an opinio or δόξα which was a function of the
rational intelligence: nor could he regard the corruption of human
nature as due primarily to the evil influence of training and environment‚
a view which is the natural consequence (though not always the consistent
lesson) of the doctrine of Zeno and Chrysippus. Of this view there is no
trace in Cicero's discussion here, and if we except one passage there is
nothing in Cicero's treatment of the question which can fairly be inter-
preted as due to an acquaintance with the teaching of Posidonius. That
apparent exception is the passage in which Cicero deals with an objection
to the Chrysippean view of the possibility of aegritudo in the case of a
philosopher, which, as it concerns the treatment proper to be adopted
in such a case, will be discussed later.

From the discussion of the nature of aegritudo Cicero passes to the
question of its appropriate treatment and cure. Setting aside the view
of Epicurus that the mind of the patient should be induced to dwell
upon pleasurable experiences or anticipations (15, 33 3 31, 76), he
enumerates the various niethods recommended by experience or philo-
sophy3 these are (a) the effect of time (16, 353 22, 53 f.; 30, 743 31, 76);
(b) praemeditatio(14, 293 16, 345 22, 525 23, 553 25, 60); (c) considera-
tion of the real nature of the object which has given rise to the feeling
of aegritudo (23, 563 31, 763 32, 77); (d) consideration of the nature of
the feeling itself (25, 61) 3 (e) reflexion upon the irrational and useless
character ofthe feeling (27, 64; 28, 663 31, 76 f.; 33, 793 34, 82); (f) the
appeal to the experiences of others (23, 563 33, 79). To each of these
Cicero allows some weight‚ as in the case of his own bereavement he
had experienced their value when for his Consolatio he had collected
and tried thern all (31, 76), though he admits that their values vary.

(a) The value of time as an agent of healing resides in the cogitatio
diurna for which it affords opportunity. This is a point upon which the
views of Chrysippus had been criticized by Posidonius. The view of
the former is given by Galen op. cit. p. 394 M. [p. 419 K.] ὅτι δὲ ἐν
