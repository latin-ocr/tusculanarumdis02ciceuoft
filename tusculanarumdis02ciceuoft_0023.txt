INTRODUCTION xvii

(c) The Pythagoreans and the early Romans alike are said to
have sung to instrumental accompaniment and the poem of Appius
Caecus seems to show Pythagorean influence, §g 2—4.

Though the Romans have been philosophie from of old, no Roman
philosopher can be named before the age of Laelius and Scipio. When
these were young men the embassy of Diogenes, Carneades (and Critolaus)
was sent to Rome in 155 B.c.‚ ἓ 5.

The philosophy of the schools founded by Plato and Aristotle is
hardly as yet represented in Latin literature, but the Epicurean writings
of Amafinius have had much influence, ἓ 6.

The theme for discussion, §5 8-10.

The question for the day's discussion is “Is the wise man free from
all irrational emotions ? '² Annoyance was disposed of the previous day 3
sear is so closely connected with annoyance that the same decision applies
to each. Exultant joy and desire remain to be considered, ἓ 8.

The Stoics give much attention to the classification and definition
of the several emotions. The Peripatetics disregard this department and
attend rather to the remedial treatment of the emotions. Cicero will
deal with classification and division first, ἓξ 9, 10.

A. Stoic division and definitions of the emotions, ἓξ 11—33.

(a) Perturbatio and its genera and their subdivisions defined, §g 1 1—2 2.

Zeno defines perturbatio as ‘ auersa a recta ratione contra naturam
animi commotio.' There are four main divisions (cf. iii 11, 24 and table
on p. xxxi), viz. desire and joy, annoyance and sear, ξ 1 1.

All perturbationes are due to a mental decision and to the forming of
a mere opinion, ἓ 14. The forming of such an opinion is a weak act of
assent, ἕ 15. Constantia is opposed to perturbatio, being a movement
of the soul in accordance with reason (εὐπάθεια). The constantia opposed
to desire is reasonable wish (uoluntas, βούλησις); to unrestrained mirth
(laetitia gestiens) is opposed joy (gaudium, χαρά, εὔλογος ἔπαρσις), a
tranquil movement 3 to fear (metus) is opposed prudence (cautu), εὐλάβεια) ;
annoyance (aegritudo) has no constantia opposed to it, §g 12-15.

Each separate perturbatio has its subdivisions, ἓ 16.

Definitions of the several subdivisions of each perturbatio, §g 17-2 1.
The source of all irrational emotions is want of self-control (intempe-
rantia, ἀκράτεια), ἓ 22.

(b) Stoic comparison between diseases of the mind and diseases
of the body, ἐξ 23—32.

Disordered states of the mind arise from the disturbing effect of
emotions just as similar states of the body arise from corruption of blood,
or redundancy of phlegm or bile.
