Stoics‚ the other sects are passed in review in the light of Carneades'
dictum. After enumerating the fines adopted by the various schools (30,
84) he proceeds to examine thern in order. The case of the Peripatetics‚
which he takes first (30, 85), is the easiest. With the exception of
Theophrastus, they rank the bona corporis and the bona externa so low
in comparison with the bona animi, that the happiness derived from the
latter overshadows any unhappiness due to the loss of the former: besides,
the argument which Cicero had learned from Antiochus (8, 22) applies—
life can be called happy if it is predominantly so. He proceeds to argue
that the Peripatetics can all consistently speak with the extravagance of
the Stoics. So may Callipho and Diodorus. The case of others is more
difficult3 but that of Epicurus being, to outward seeming, most difficult
of all, he offers to show that even he may consistently speak of virtue as
sufficient to ensure happiness. The only argument in this section is one
which Cicero confessedly borrowed from Antiochus, whose teaching,
whether written or oral, may legitimately be regarded as the “ source '²
of this section.

From 31, 88 to the end of the book Cicero is engaged upon a
demonstration of the compatibility of a belief in his thesis with adherence
to the teaching of Epicurus. Epicurus, he asserts, despises death and
pain and poverty: he is abstemious, and free from avarice like Anacharsis,
Socrates, Xenocrates and Diogenes. The Epicurean division of cupidi-
tates is insisted upon to prove on the one hand that the Epicureans did
not attach an excessive value to the satisfaction of particular desires, and
on the other that to the Epicurean the mind was the standard of pleasure,
the body being merely the percipient. This being so, the life of the
Epicurean philosopher, aided by recollection and anticipation, would be
a long and unbroken series of pleasures. The moderatiori in eating and
drinking exemplified by Epicurus is dwelt upon and enforced (34, 97—
3 5, 102) by other examples: examples are given of philosophical indiffer-
ence to zjgnobilz'tas (36, 103—105), and to exile (37, 106—-38, 110), to
blindness (38, 111-39, 115), to loss of hearing (40, 116-117), to pain
(40, 1 17—41, 1 19). In all these cases he asserts that on the principles of
Epicurus the sapiens is able to derive enough pleasure from life to
overbalance his calamities and may therefore be called happy or may
in the last resort escape from pain by suicide.

Thus he concludes (41, 120) the judgment of Carneades as to the
essential agreement of all schools of philosophy upon the sufficiency of
virtue for a happy life is proved to be sound.

In this section Cicero, as he says both at the beginning (29, 83> and
at the end (41, 120), is defending a view of Carneades. It is a natural
presumption that he became acquainted with this view from the works
