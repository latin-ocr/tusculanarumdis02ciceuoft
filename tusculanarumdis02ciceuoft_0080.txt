astringere, ‘compress‚' ef. Brut. 90,
309 ‘eram cum Stoico Diodoto...a quo...
in dialectica exercebar, quae quasi con-
tracta et adstricta eloquentia putanda est’;
also Brut. 31, 120 quoted on ἓ 22, below.

nostro instituto = more oratorio.

uagabimur: cf. ‘neque dilatat argu·
mentum’ in Paradoxa ἕ 2 above.

VH. §14. quoniam: ellipticzlzoc dico
quoniam or non dixi illum confidentem
quoniam hoc uerbum... ; cf. 9, ἰο non dixi
inuidiam, compared by T.S.

confidens: the participle was more
usual at all times in a bad sense than in
a good one, cf. the exx. in Nonius 262;
it is used in a good sense in Ter. And.
v 2, 14 ‘ellum, confidens, catus.' The
good sense is more common with the
adverb confidenter. Confidentia has both
senses.

atqui was much used to introduce a
minor premiss in syllogistic argument, cf.
i 43, 104 n. on ‘in corpore autem.³ It is
therefore read here by editors generally,
though atque has much better MS support.
Fluctuations in MSS between atque and
atqui are very frequent, cf. v 15, 43 init.‚
18, 53 init.; N.D. ii 15, 41 init. It may
be observed that et was sometimes thus
used (cf. ξ 18), and therefore atque ‘and

further' does not seem in itself unsuitable
but the meaning yielded by atqui seems
better here [cf. the similar use of καὶ μήν
in Greek}

ita fit ut repugnet: Hei„ Posen
Progr. p. 19, maintains that these words
are a gloss summing up, out of place, the
argument which is again summed up lower
down in non cadunt autem. . . ‚Butthe argu·
ment would not run on if these words
were cut out, and the conclusion to be
reached is not that the brave man is not
liable to annoyance but that the wise man
is not so.

lVe have in this chapter three chain
arguments to prove that the wise man
cannot suffer annoyance, the first occupy-
ing the whole of ἓ 143 the second from
praeterea down to non cadet zg’z'tur in
sap. aegritudOE the third from et quem ad
modum to the end of ξ 15. The stages in
the first argument are the following: he
who is brave is also confident: he who is
confident does not sear: but he who is
liable to annoyance is also liable to sear:
hence liability to annoyance is out of
keeping with bravery. At this point
Cicero takes a new start and brings the
argument down to the same point by
another set of inferences, viz.—he who is
liable to annoyance would seem liable to
sear, loss of spirit, despondency: he who
is liable to these is liable to become a
slave, to admit defeat: he who is liable
to this is liable to timidity and cowardice:
