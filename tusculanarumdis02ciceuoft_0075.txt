Graeci...flaeaviav unde appellent: the
root man· from which μανία is derived is
found also in μαινάς and μάντις in Gk.
and in the Latin words mens and moneo:
Giles‚ Manual qf Comp. Plzz'l. pp. 32 ff.

distinguimus, ‘subdivide.' Cic. takes
μανία to be the Gk. general term and
seems to find no particular term to corre-
spond to insania and*only an inadequate
term to correspond to furor. But he
does not indicate a Latin general term to
include insania and furor and his as-
sertions with regard to μανία and μελαγ-
χολία are incorrect, μανία not μελαγχολία
being the usual word for furor in Hippo-
crates and other pre-CiceronianGk.writers.
Cf. Sylburg in M0., where it is also
pointed out that Cic. elsewhere sails to
observe his own distinction e.g. in Off.
iii 25, 95 ‘si gladium quis apud te sana
mente deposuerit, repetat insaniens,’
where furiosus would be the proper word
according to the distinction here drawn.

iuncta stultitia: examples of the abl.
without prep., to express that which is
united with something else, are rare and
are confined to the participle and gerun—
dive, unless v 33, 96, where most editors
now follow Madv. in inserting cum after
tum, be an instance from the finite verb.
Instances are found in Att. ix 10, 4
‘infinitum bellum iunctum miserrima
fuga'3 Or. iii 14, 55 ‘magis probitate
iungenda summaque prudentia,' where
see Wilkins’ n. Brut. 44, 162 quoted by
Kiih. on v 33, 96 seems to require emen-
dation3 see Piderit's and Kellogg's n.
In Leg. iii 20. 47 ‘id est enim iunctum
magistratibus' the case may be dat. not
abl„ or cum may have fallen out after
tum. coniungi is more common than

patet latius: being united with folly it

has a wide application since all stulti are
msam.

iili quidem: i 3, 6 n.

uerbo: abl. of means. ‘They are un-
fortunate in their word.’

quasi uero: for the pres. subj. cf.
1 22, 50 n.

ac non=ac non polius, cf. i 7, 13 n.
on ‘et non eos.’

Athamantem: Athamas, father of
Phrixus and Helle by Nephele, and of
Learchus and Melicerta by Ino, was
driven mad by Juno and slew Learchus
and pursued Ino, who jumped into the
sea with Melicerta, whereupon she was
changed into Leucothea and M. into
Palaemon. Cf. i 12, 28 n.; ovid, Met.
iv 416—562.

Alcmaeonem: Amphiaraus joined the
expedition of the Seven against Thebes,
induced thereto by his wife Eriphyle,
who had been bribed with the gift of the
golden necklace. At Thebes the earth
opened and swallowed him together with
his chariot. Before quitting Argos, know-
ing the fate that was in store for him,
he charged his sons to avenge him upon
their mother when they should be grown
up. Alcmaeon accordinglyslewhisrnother
and was in consequence driven mad and
perseeuted by the Furies. Cf. ii 25, 60.
