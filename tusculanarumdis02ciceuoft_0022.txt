xvi INTRODUCTION

over it is of no avail. Cleanthes' remedy which consisted in pointing out
that there was no evil where there was no disgrace is not a practical one.
His statement is not even always true; it was not true, for instance,
when Alcibiades grieved because he did not possess virtue, ᾖ 77, 78.

To point out to a sufferet that his misfortune is a common one does
not bring conviction in every case. The truest remedy, but one not easy
to apply while the annoyance is at its height, is that of Chrysippus, which
consists in convincing the sufferer that his grief is due to his own volition‚
and to an idea that it is demanded by duty. We must vary our mode of
treatment according to the person treated, ἓ 79. .

EPILOGUE. The discussion has digressed from the original question
which was “Is the wise man affected by annoyance?’' Instead of dealing
with that question we have discovered that the evil which is involved in
annoyance results not from inevitable and necessary causes but from an
act of will and erroneous opinion, ξ 80. Moreover we have dealt chiefly
with one form of annoyance, grief for the dead (luctus), this being the
severest of all its subdivisions, but the same treatment applies to all the
rest, §g 81—4.

Our ancestors made early progress in constitutional development and
in the military art, ἓ 1 3 and Cicero sees reason for thinking that they

had also acquired some knowledge of philosophy. His reasons are the
following:—

(a) It is not likely that the early Romans were deaf to the
doctrines of Pythagoras taught in Magna Graecia and widely cele-
brated, ἓ 2.

(b) The fiction that Numa was a Pythagorean seems to indicate
an early Roman admiration for the Pythagoreans.
