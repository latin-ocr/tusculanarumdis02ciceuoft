Archytae uitam comparabo, doctorum hominum et plane sapi-

Archimedem: the celebrated mathe-
matician and inventor who was said to

humilem homunculum, ‘an obscure
individual,’ i.e. in comparison either with
the more celebrated Plato or Archytas,
whom everyone had heard of, or with
Dionysius. The expression can hardly
be ironical as Mayor (Juv. iii 76 n. on
geometres) assumes. The rhetorical ex-
pression used by Sil. Ital. Pun. xiv 343
‘ nudus opum ' in describing Archimedes
(quoted by Dav. and subsequent edd.)
ought not to be appealed to as an inter-
pretation of humilis here. Archimedes,
according to Plutarch, Marc. c. 14, was
Ἱέρωνι τῷ βασιλεῖ συγγενὴς...καὶ φίλος,
and can scarcely have been in poverty.

puluere et radio, ⁶ from his drawing
board and pencil'3 an abacus covered
with fine sand was used by mathema-
ticians, and diagrams were made on it
with a radius or sharp—pointed rod. Cf.
Fin. v 19, 503 Pers. i 131; Sen. Epp.
74⁹ 2 ·

It geems better to take a puluere with
excitabo (the idea being that of metaph-
orically summoning Archimedes to leave
his geometry sor the moment) than with
homunculum on the analogy of such
phrases as seruus ab epistulis.

have assisted by his warlike machines in
the defence of Syracuse in 212 B.C. ; he
was killed by Marcellus' soldiers while
engaged in solving a mathematical prob-
lem (Liv. xxv 31, 93 Plut. Marc. 19);
for his orrery see i 25, 63 and n.

quaestor: as Cicero was quaestor
(75 B.C.) of the W. part of Sicily,
with his headquarters at Lilybaeum, his
visits to Syracuse can only have been
occasional.

sepulerum : cf. Livy xxv 31, 10 (ofthe
death of Archimedes) ⁴ aegre id Marcellum
tulisse sepulturaeque curam habitam et
propinquis etiam inquisitis honori prae-
sidioque nomen ac memoriam eius suisse.’

tenebam: sc. mente, cf. Off. iii 16, 67
‘qui id, quod emerat, quo iure esset
teneret ' ; the usage is common in Plautus,
e.g. Epid. 292 ‘hic poterit cauere recte,
iura qui et leges tenet'; Most. 171 ‘ut
lepide omnis mores tenet.'

The iambic lines referred to are not
extant. By the diminutive senariolos Cic.
does not seem to mean to express depre-
ciation of their quality but to indicate
their length as contrasted with that of the
hexameter.
