of the disciples of Carneades who recorded his doctrines (Diog. Laert.
iv 6 5): but it would seem to follow from Cicer0⁷s references to Carneades
that, while he laid down the general position ‘quaecumque dissentientium
philosophorum sententia sit de finibus, tamen uirtus satis lzaheat ad
uitam beatam praesidii' (29, 83), his “proof'' of it was mainly a discus-
sion of the apparent discrepancies between the Peripatetics and the
Stoics (cf. 41, 120: ‘nam cum, quaecumque bona Peripateticis, eadem
Stoia's commoda uiderentur, neque tamen Peripatetici plus tribuerent
diuitiis, bonae ualetudini, ceteris rebus generis eiusdem quam Stoici, cum
ea re non uerbis ponderarentur, causam esse dissidendi negabat⁷ 3 29,
83: ‘ Carneadem disputare solitum accepimus‚· sed is, ut contra Stoicos,
quos studiosissime semper resellebaff). In the detailed discussion of
the application of Carneades’ dictum to the Epicurean ethics there is
no mention of Carneades, and it may be inferred that the substance
of 31, 88-41‚ 119 is not directly due to any recorded discussion of
his.

In these sections Cicero quotes Epicurus (or professes acquaintance
with his works) more than once: 31, 88, ‘eum diem quo moritur beatum
appellat’,· 32, 89, ‘nemo de tenui uictu plura dixit'3 3 3, 93 ‘uides, crede,
ut Epicurus cupiditatium genera diuiserit', 33, 95, ‘totumque lzoc de uoluptate
sic ille praecipit ut... ² 3 38, 1 10, ‘non sine causa igitur Epicurus ausus est
dicere.' He refers also to the writings of the Epicureans, 33, 94, ‘lzoc loco
multa ab Epicureis disputantur' 3 34, 97, ‘atque liis similia ad uictum etiam
transferuntur’, 38, 111, ‘quidam etiam disputent! He notes the verbal
agreement between Epicurus and Hieronymus, 41, 1 18, ‘llaec eadem quae
Epicurus, totidem uerbis dicit Hieroriymusss To assume, in view of the
enormous number of treatises left by Epicurus (Diog. Laert. x 26, γέγονε
δὲ πολυγραφώτατος ὁ Ἐπίκουρος, πάντας ὑπερβαλλόμενος πλήθει βιβλίων),
of his epistles containing a compendium of his doctrines, of his κύριαι
δόξαι, of his philosophical importance, of the popularity of his doctrines
in Rome, of Cicero's lifelong devotion to Greek philosophy and his
constant study of it, that he did not take these references directly from
Epicurus, but borrowed them from some later Epicurean or some Sceptic
like Philo, is an impossible position. On the other hand, it is plain that
he owed a good deal to Epicurean apologists, eager to show that
Epicurus was not so bad as his opponents painted him. Of such
apologies it is plain that there was a very considerable number. They
did not prove that uirtus was sufficient to ensure complete happiness:
but they did endeavour to show (what Cicero, with no very exacting
philosophical conscience, held to be practically the same thing) that it
was possible for a man who held uoluptas to be the chief good to be
consistently happy, through recollection‚ anticipation and the selection
