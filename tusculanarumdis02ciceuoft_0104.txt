‘stulte anteposuit': the adv. expresses a
judgment with regard to the action, not
the manner in which it is done. See
Madv. on Fin. iv 23, 63; Kiih. Gram.
p. 597 Anm. 2.
eleuet = extenuet.
cogitatio: for the verbal with acc. and
infin. see Madv. ἓ 395; Roby11§§1351-2.
non accidere possit: for the order of
words cf. 14, 30 n. on ‘non euenire
posse.’
uitae lex: compressed for uitae legis
meditatz'0; nearly the same as med. con-
dicionis humanae, further explained in
the next sentence ‘neque enim, qui rerum
naturam...', cf. v 13, 38 ‘manet in lege
naturae'; Fam. vi 6, 12 ‘leuat enirn
dolorem communis quasi legis et humanae
condicionis recordatio.' ‘A consideration
of the human lot, of the general laws
under which men live, and a preparation
to obey those laws.' Virtue‚ according to
Chrysippus, consists in living in harmony
with oneself and with nature in general,
cf. Diog. L. vii 89 φύσιν δὲ Χρύσιππος
μὲν ἐξακούει, ᾖ ἀκολούθως δεῖ ζῆν, τήν τε
κοινὴν καὶ ἰδίως τὴν ἀνθρωπίνην. We must
be in harmony with the world in which
we live, and consequently know that
vicissitudes of fortune are inevitable. Cf.
25, 60 ‘necessitas ferendae condicionis
humanae quasi cum deo pugnare prohibet
admonetque esse hominem, quae cogitatio
magno opere luctum leuat.'
fut semper: as Epicurus maintained,
c . ἓ 3²·
proprio: the Stoics held that ‘the
proper study os mankind is man.’ Of the
three main divisions of philosophy, δια-

λεκτική, φυσική and ἠθική, the last-men·
tioned was ‘the central point towards
which all other inquiries converge. Even
natural science, although lauded as the ς
inmost shrine of philosophy, is, according l
to Chrysippus, only necessary for the ¹
philosopher to enable him to distinguish
between things good and evil, between
What should be done and what should be
left undone.' Zeller, Stoics, etc„ c. iv ·
p. 56 and Chrysippus in Plut. Stoic. Rep.
c. 9 p. 10, 35 d there quoted.

fruatur officio: Manutius and Lam-
binus, whether from MSS or their own
conjecture, substituted fungatur for fiua-
tur, and Dav. Lall. Ern. and Kuh. follow
them, but almost every other modern
editor retains fruatur. If, as Kiih. sup-
poses, fruatur has been substituted by
some one whose taste was offended by the
recurrence of fungatur, then, since all
the best MSS have fruatur, this must have
been done at least as early as the 6th
cent. A.D., a period when interpolation
was not in vogue and a period, too, when
such recurrences gave no offence. It is
more likely that fungatur is repeated
from two lines higher up, in the late MSS
in which it occurs. fruatur qffici0=qfficio
fungendo delectetur, cf. Hand on Wopkens
p. 112. Hand compares Senec. Ep. 93, 9
‘omnium rerum cognitione fruiti sumus.'
There is also a contrast which would
be lost by the change from fruatur to
frangatur: the course prescribed gives
him before missortune comes a congenial
occupation: after its arrival a three-sold
consolation.
