quoniam non id agitur hoc ternpore. nam cum carminibus soliti
illi esse dicantur et praecepta quaedam occultius tradere et
mentes suas a cogitationum intentione cantu fidibusque ad tran-
quillitatem traducere, grauissimus auctor in Originibus dixit
Cato morem apud maiores hunc epularum fuisse ut deinceps,
qui accubarent, canerent ad tibiam clarorum uirorum laudes
atque uirtutes. ex quo perspicuum est et cantus tum fuisse di-

of Numa, these writings being referred to
by Piso Censorius and Valerius Antias as
Pythagorean, cf. Livy xl 29; Pliny N.H.
xiii 13, 85—7; the criticism of Polybius,
referred toin the n. on ‘Numam...Pytha-
goreum‚' above, shows that the story was
current in the time of the younger Scipio
and this is also indicated by the statement
of Plutarch, Quaest. Rom. 10, 76, that
Castor referred Roman customs to Pytha-
goras τὰ Ῥωμαϊκὰ τοῖς Πυθαγορικοῖς
συνοικειῶν. Cf. Dav. here and Rlz. Mus.
LVII p. 236. Mommsen 1 p. 271 finds
indications of Pythagorean influence in
the Roman calendar.

carminibus : ⁴ By applying mathe-
matics to music the Pythagoreans became
the founders of the scientific theory of
sound... The practical importance of
music, however, was quite as great among
them ; it was cultivated partly as a means
of moral education, partly in connexion
with the art of medicine-³ Zeller, Pre-
Soc. Phil. 1 348. And ibid. n. 2, ‘The
Harmony of the Pythagoreans presupposes
a diligent study of music,' cf. p. 43¹- For
the χρυσᾶ ἔπη formerly ascribed with
little reason to Pythagoras and the ἱερὸς
λόγος, both mentioned here by Hei. in
his n., see Zeller, l. c. p. 31 1 n. 2.

occultius: cf. Porphyr. Vit. Pyth. 41

and doctrines. For the question of
esoteric and exoteric doctrines see Zeller,
l. c. pp. 342, 356.

Vit. Pyth. 32 says that Pythagoras began
the day by calming his mind with the
strains of the lyre and singing pacans.

Sellar, Rom. Poets eff tlze Republic,
pp. 37—8. [Ribbeck‚ Gesclz. der Rc‘im.
Dz‘cht. 1 8.] The reasoning, as Hei.
observes, is remarkable: the Pythagoreans
had maxims in metrical form and calmed
their minds by singing to the lyre; the
early Romans sang in turn at banquets
the deeds of heroes to the flute; therefore
the early Romans were acquainted with
the Pythagorean doctrine.

discriptos: Turnebus, Advers. vii c. 17,
defends rescriptos of the MSS, comparing
ἀναγράφειν, and Dav. takes the same
view. Kiih. says ‘cantus uocum sonis
rescribere est cantus scribendo (h.e. notis
signisue) reuocare uel redigere ad aptos
(acutos et graues) uocum sonos, quod
nos uocamus komponiren, tonsetzen.'
But illustrationis of this use are wanting.
J. Fr. Gronovius, on Livy vii 2, 7, and
other early scholars conjectured descriptos,
which VVes. Em. 111 1 supports and Bai.
adopts. But Sff. points out that the
meaning is not cantus ex uocum sonis
signatos or notatos but c. ex u. s. dispositos.
discrzpto is the better reading in Liv. vii
2, 7 and no substitution is more common
in MSS than that of describere for di-
scrz'bere3 see variants in i 17, 38 and
