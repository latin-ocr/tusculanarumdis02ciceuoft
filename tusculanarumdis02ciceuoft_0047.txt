subscribe, thereby ranging himself on the side of the Stoics. He has the
usual digression upon the superiority of Latin to Greek as an instrument
of philosophical expression, though his idea of the strict meaning of
πάθος is a mistaken one. There is nothing in this section to indicate
direct reliance upon any Greek (or other) authority.

With 11, 24 Cicero enters upon the main subject of the book, the
nature of aegritudo and the method of its cure. It has already been shown
that the views taken of both these points are certainly not those of
Posidonius, and that on the other hand they in many respects coincide
with the known views of Chrysippus and are not in any case contradictory
of what we know of his teaching. But the treatment is complicated by
digressions upon the views of the Cyrenaics and the Epicureans. The
Cyrenaics are criticized for their view of the origin of aegritudo, which
referred it to an “unlooked for and unexpeeted evil‚⁷' and they are
praised for having seen that praemeditatio was a sound method of treat-
ment. But there is only a very superficial attempt made to discuss their
position 5 the superiority of Chrysippus' definition to theirs is asserted,
not proved, and if Cicero had a Greek authority here he has either cut
it down so as to exclude everything characteristic or its treatment must
have been so superficial as to make it not worth consulting.

The same may be said of the criticism of Epicurus. With the views
of the Epieureans Cicero had been acquainted for years. He had studied
under Zeno the Epicurean, whose lectures indeed he quotes in 17, 38.
There is nothing in his remarks upon Epicurus here, except the Cicero-
nian rhetoric, which was not common form 3 and it may safely be said
that if Cicero was not capable of composing these sections without
reference to a Greek handbook he was not capable, and never would
have dreamed, of writing philosophical treatises at all. It will hardly be
contended that the quotations from Epicurus in 18, 41 f. must have been
derived from quotations in a Greek original. Cicero must have been
familiar with the “liber qui continet omnem disciplinam Epicuri '' and
we need not assume that his quotations from it were not the result of
his own reading and memory. The same remark must be made about
the poetical quotations scattered through the book. The quotations from
Latin poets (like the illustrations from Roman history) are admitted by
all critics to be the result of Cicero's own reading. With the quotations
from the Greek poets he must have been equally familiar, if not from
the study of the poets themselves, then at least from his study of Greek
philosophers in whose writings they seem to have occurred ad nauseam.
The same passages were to be met in Chrysippus, Crantor and Posidonius,
pressed by each into the service of his own particular theory or introduced
for the embellishment of his pages. Many of them must have been long
