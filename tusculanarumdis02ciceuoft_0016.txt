Χ INTRODUCTION

become so thoroughly unhealthy as to be practieally insane, a word which
taken literally means “in an unhealthy state,'’ which (according to
philosophers) a mind under such conditions undoubtedly-is-Latin
brings this point out better than Greek. A mind under the sway of
passion is out of its own control, though here two states of mind must
be distinguished: one, temporary, called furor or μελαγχολία, to which
even wise men are subject, and the other (insania or μανία), a state
inconsistent with true wisdom, ἐξ 7—11.

The position to be combatted is one that appeals to human nature
on its tender side3 and there is much to be said for Crantor's view that
total absence of feeling can only be secured at the cost of brutality of
mind and torpor of body. And yet Cicero fears that this view merely
humours our weakness. We must remove this emotion3 yet so deep-
rooted is it that an ineradicable minimum will probably be left. And we
must deal with the other emotions, too, but with this one first, §g 12, 13.

A. Cicero now proceeds to put forward compressed Stoic arguments
in syllogistic form to prove that the wise man is not affected by
annoyance, §g 14—2 1.

(a) Fear and annoyance are concerned with the same objects:
the man who is liable to the one is also liable to the other: the wise
man is not liable to fear, therefore he is not liable to annoyance, ἓ 14.

(b) The wise man is too high-spirited to regard human concerns
and being so must be superior to annoyance, ἓ 15.

(c) The mind which is annoyed, like the eye which is infiamed,
cannot do its work. The mind of the wise man is always equal to its
work: therefore it is always free from annoyance.

(d) The wise man is sels-controlled (σώφρων), and therefore calm,
and therefore free from annoyance, c. 8, ἐξ 16-18.

(e) If the wise man were liable to annoyance he would also be
liable to anger, §g 18, 19.

(j) The wise man cannot fall into a state of envy or compassion 3
but the former is annoyance at the good fortune, and the latter annoy-
ance at the evil fortune, of another, therefore the wise man cannot fall
into annoyance, §g 20, 21.

B. These fine-drawn arguments must be considerably expanded, but still
principally according to Stoic views, for the Peripatetic theory of
the mean as applied to emotions does not recommend itself to Cicero,
ἓ 22.

The original question: “Is the wise man affected by annoyance?”
