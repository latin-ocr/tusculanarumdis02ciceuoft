xlviii INTRODUCTION

BOOK V.

Zietzschmann op. cit. pp. 32—70 gives a long and careful analysis of
the possible sources of the book. He discovers evident traces of
Posidonius in the introduction3 the view that philosophy is the source
of civilisation (2, 5) is expressly attributed by Seneca (Epp. 90, 5) to
Posidonius. The treatment in cc. 5-26 is obviously Stoic: the arguments
in 15, 43 ff. are drawn from Chrysippus (Plut. de Stoic. repugn. 13,
p. 1039 Stob. Ecl. ii. 126, 202>: so is the treatment of fear in 18, 52
(cf. Stob. Ecl. ii 172 Diog. Laert. vii 112); and the long digression about
Dionysius is like Chrysippus ‘qm‘ totos libros adscribere solebat) But
it is not necessary to assume an immediate dependence on Chrysippus:
it is more likely that Cicero's source is some controversial Stoic hand-
book composed to defend Stoicismagainstthe Peripatetics and Academics.
Since the tenets of Antiochus seem to be often in view it is probable that
the source was contemporary with him. And of the generation of
Antiochus what Stoic was so prominent as Posidonius? It accords with
this that the ascription of the premier place in philosophy to physics, not
logie (24, 68), is characteristic of Posidonius in contrast to Chrysippus
(Diog. Laert. vii. 40), and the position accorded to Plato (eg. 12, 34)
points in the same direction. If Posidonius be the source of this part of
the book his η’θικὸς λόγος (Diog. Laert. vii 91) was probably drawn upon
chiefly. A short passage (27, 76-28, 82) is probably Cicero's own and
serves to introduce his next source Antiochus whose De fine bonorum is
responsible for the matter of 29, 82—31‚ 88: the argument of 31, 86 is
indeed expressly attributed to Antiochus in 8, 22. The remainder of the
book is from an Epicurean source, as may be seen, if detailed proof be
required, from a comparison of 33, 93 with Diog. Laert. x 130,- of 33,
95 with Diog. Laert. x 1 29 and of 34, 97—99 with Diog. Laert. x 130—131.
It is not however any work of EpicuruS, but that of some later Epicurean
writer, upon which Cicero draws, and this may be either Zeno or Phaedrus
or possibly Apollodorus: in any case, it was the same as the source of
Plutarch de exilio. Hirzel op. cit. iii pp. 468 ff. holds that the case for
regarding Posidonius as one of Cicero's sources is weak. He thinks that
the references to Plato are not sufficient in themselves to prove it and
that it is impossible to suppose that aStoic like Posidonius could have used
the language of 12, 34 with regard to Zeno. Nor is the case for Antiochus
any stronger. The view defended by Cicero that, no matter what view
may be taken of the summum bonum, the practice of virtue is sufficient
to ensure happiness is the view not of Antiochus but of Carneades:
indeed it is plain from De Finn. v. that Antiochus would have denied
this if uoluptas or uacuz'tas doloris were assumed to be the summum bonum.
