tends to all our opinions.

optime naturae uim uidisse, ‘to have
best perceived the true meaning ofnature.’
This emendation of Madv. in his n. on
‘ uis naturae perspici potest' Fin. iii 19,
62 has driven out Bentley’s optimam
magistram inuidisse which was accepted
by Dav. Mo. and others. The conjecture
of Keil optime natm-am ii uidisse is elever
but uidisse naturam is not quite the
expression required.

honoribus, imperiiS, ‘civiland military
preeminence.’ So long as office and com-
mand were bestowed by vote of the people
popularis gloria conduced to and resulted
from the attainment of both. populari
gloria therefore sums up the effect of
honoribus imperiis and ad quam refers
only to it, not, as Kuh. holds, to the
other two words as well.

ad quam fertur: trans, ‘at this the
best men among us aim and, though they
desire the truly honourable, the search
for which preeminently belongs to nature,
they are occupied with the veriest un-
realities and pursue no well-defined form
of virtue but merely a shadowy semblance
of glory.’

optimus quisque: from the social, not
from the moral, point of view.

tris semina innata uirtutum of ἓ 2.
Cf. Seneca, Ep. 121, 14; Fin. iii 7, ²3

It is well-known that the Stoics taught
that every living thing tends to preserve
its own nature; that nothing can be in
harmony with the nature of any individual
unless it be in harmony with the course
of the universe (cf. Diog. L. vii 88 ἀκο-
λούθως τῇ φύσει ζῆν); that a rational life
in agreement with the general course of
the world is the highest good, or virtue;
that virtue alone is good. See Zeller,
Stoz‘cs, etc. c. x pp. 214—6.

quam una natura maxime anquirit:
Kiih. thinks natura here :ii homines qui,
naturam seculi, recta uel absoluta ratione
instructi sunt. But that meaning would
be very obscurely expressed and natura
here is certainly the same as natura in
ἐξ 2 and 3. natura is animate, since ‘the
terms Soul os the world, Reason of the
world, Nature, Universal LaW, Provi-
dence, Destiny—all mean the same thing ’
Zeller, Stoics‚ etc„ c. vi p. 145. ‘ Nature
seeks out the honourable ' I take to mean
(in more prosaic form) that the honourable
is essential to harmony with nature or
conformity to universal law.

una intensifies maxime, cf. Fin. ii 13,
42 ‘uoluptas quam unam uirtus minimi
facit? Trans. ‘whichnature preeminently
seeks out.’

unam is read by Man. Lamb. and most
modern editors except Mo. Kl. and Kiih.
The meaning with unam would be ‘ which
is preeminently the thing that nature
seeks out.³ The objection of Kiih. that
this is the only thing that natura seeks
out seems insuperable though he does not
take natura in the same sense as 1 do.
Virtue or the honestum is the only good3
natura demands this alone, not this pre-
