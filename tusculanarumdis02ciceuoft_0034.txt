xxviii INTRODUCTJON

as a life in harmony with nature ; such a life is the duty of the wise man
and is possible for him, and therefore happiness is within his reach.
Nothing more can be said about happiness than this, ἐξ 80—82 init.

Cicero's opponent grants the validity of the argument so far, but he
would like Cicero to develope a statement made during his argument
(in ἓ 75) that even the Peripatetics should admit that the wise man was
supremely happy 3 he is not sure that this would be consistent with
their main position, ξ 82.

The proposition true from the standpoint of all philosophers, §3834 18.

Cicero promises, availing himself of the liberty accorded him as a
member of the New Academy, leaving the Stoic view aside (which,
as has been sufficiently demonstrated‚ supports his conclusion), to prove
the consistency of his thesis with the doctrine of the good held by rival
schools, ἕξ 83, 84 init.

The philosophie schools may be divided into two classes, according
as they regard the chief good as (a) simple, or (b) composite: (a) to the
first class belong the Stoics (whose chief good is virtue), the Epicureans
(pleasure), the school of Hieronymus (absence of pain), the school of
Carneades (enJ'oyment of naturae prima bona) 3 (b) to the second class
belong the Peripatetics and Old Academy (who divide the good into
bona animi, bona corporis and bona externa), the followers of Dinomachus
and Callipho (pleasure and virtue) 3 the followers of Diodorus (virtue and
absence of pain). The schools of Aristo, Pyrrho and Erillus are out of
date, ἐξ 84, 85.

These are now taken one by one: (a) The Peripatetics, who assert
that the animi bona are immeasurably superior to the other two, can
assent to the view expounded by Cicero, by regarding the absence of
the bona emporis and bona externa as negligible or by understanding
“happy '' to mean “happy multo maiore ex parte.'' (β) The followers of
Callipho and Diodorus can speak of virtue as producing happiness
because they admit virtue to be immeasurably preferable to pleasure
and absence of pain. (γ) The Epicureans and the followers of Hierony-
mus and Carneades will be harder put to it, yet even they will admit
that the mind being judge for itself of what is good and bad can rise
superior to mere appearanceS, ἓξ 8 5-88.

If the truth of our position can be proved even from the premisses
of Epicurus it must be admitted to be consistent with the premisses of
all the others. Now Epicurus proclaims his indifference to death (for as
it means annihilation it need not concern us> and to pain (which can be
relieved either by recollections of past pleasure or by the thought that
severe pain cannot last, while pain which lasts cannot be severe). No
philosopher takes up a nobler position in regard to these two sources
