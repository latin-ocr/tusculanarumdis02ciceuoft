tollenda : this reading, which was also
a conjecture of Lambinus, is to be preferred
to toleranda of the best MSS. toleranda is
impossible in view of the corresponding
phrase in the example taken up in the
next clause ‘hominem aegre serre nihil
oportere.'

eoncedendum, ‘ we may have to leave

attempt be made to prove that paupertas

possible to proceed further and argue that

there is nothing which can properly be.

described as an evil ; for concedere: cedere,

de suis temporibus quoted in Off. i 22, 77

heri : in the discussion reported in
Book iii.

malum: the phrase paupertatis malum
is in the context an easily understood
brachylogy for cogitatio paupertatem esse
malum. Bent. proposed to read (with
Gebh-'s Palatine codex) nomen and in
this he is followed by Bouh. : he gives as
his reasons ‘quippe alienum est ab hac
disputatione concedere paupertatem esse
malum : deinde si aegritudo omnino
sublata sit, non quodammodo sed prorsus
omuino paupertatis malum tollitur ' and

⁴ he explains his own reading, ‘nam qui

nihil desiderat. . .cur pauper est uocandus ? ⁷
With regard to the first point Bent. is
quite right in his assertion; the only
logical conclusion to be drawn with
regard to poverty from proving ‘hominem
aegre ferre nihil oportere ' is, not ‘ pauper-
tatem malum non esse’ but, ‘hominem
aegre ferre paupertatem non oportere’;
and this very fact is, pace Bentleii, the
justification sor quodam modo; once the
assertion ‘hominem aegre ferre pauper-

tatem non oportere' is established, it
becomes increasingly difficult (not logi-
cally impossible, but quodam modo im—
possible) to argue that paupertas is in
any real sense malum.

XXVIII. 560. Sed omnis... ‘ But
granting that all disturbances of this kind
may be cleared away by that process of
soothing the mind which consists in
proving that, etc.'; abluatur is concessive
subjunctive3 for the concessive use of
quidem after ille and is cs. i 3 6 n.: sor
the metaphor in abluatur cf. iii 18, 43
⁴ tum plane luctum ornnem absterseris ' 3
de Sen. i 2 ‘omnis absterserit senectutis
molestias)

Bent. attacks the reading with his
usual vigour ⁴ uix crediderim occultius aut
sanatu difficilius mendum in toto Cicerone
latitare' ; he objects to placatione on the
grounds that, first, the phrase perturbatio
...abluatur is absurd3 one might as well
say morbum leuari sanitate: and, secondly‚
that the word placatio cannot properly be
used where res externae are in question ε
‘ placatio enirn potius fit cum ipsa intus
aegritudo leniatur, utcumque se habeant
res externae? He objects also to the
subj. abluatur: his proposed reading is
sed cum omnis eiusmodi perturbatio
duplici ratione abluatur; he claims for
duplici ratione that it gives a proper refer-
ence for illa and haec which follow: the
emendation is adopted by Lall. and (with
lzac for duplici) by Nissen. The proposal
involves an anacoluthon, illa quidem
having no lzac to correspond: it is palaeo-
graphically highly improbable that duplici
ratione should have been corrupted into
animi placatione; and the objection to
placatio animi is unsound‚ the phrase
being=ratio placandi animi, surely a
legitimate description of an argument
addressed to an animus perturbatus.
