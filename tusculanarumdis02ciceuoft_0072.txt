philosophy of nature3 the transitional
philosophy of the Sophists was the first
to leave nature for ethical and dialectical
questions. After Socrates the dialectical
tendency is supreme. His own attention
was exclusively occupied with determining
conceptions, and enquiries respecting
virtue.

For the triple division of philosophy
cf. Ac. i 5, 19 ‘fuit ergo...philosophandi
ratio triplex: una de uita et moribus,
altera de natura et rebus occultis, tertia
de disserendo et quid uerum sit, quid
falsum, quid rectum in oratione prauomue,
quid consentiens, quid repugnans iudi-
cand0,’ and Reid’s n.

de uita et de moribus = περὶ τῶν ἠθικῶν.

For the double translation of a Greek
term see ii 2 1, 47 n. on eneruatum quodam
modo et lanffltz'dum. The repetition of
the preposition is strange, and unusual in
such translations. It is probably intru-
sive.

mentis: the ruling portion of the
animus, cf. ξ 11 ‘mentis cui regnum
totius animi a natura tributum est’ and
N.D. ii 11, ²9 quoted oni 10, 20 n.

id est msamtatem...msaniunt: this
passage is open to much suspicion. The
id est clause introduces an unnecessary
explanation and an absurd repetition.
The rest of the passage gives us the views
of philosophers in a hackneyed Stoic syl-
logism to show that all non-philosophers
are mad, though the point to be proved
is not this but that the early Romans
held mental disturbance to be identical
with madness, and a view is thus attri-
buted to philosophers which is limited
to Stoic philosophers. Then with a change
from present to past time and a meaning-
less enz‘m we have the sentence sanita-

instead of the required maiores nostri as
its only possible subject, a construction
which would leave us quite without ex-
planation of the views of the early Romans.

Sff. emends and reads idest insanitatem
ex aegroto anz‘mo...nostrz' sanitatem
animorum...comparing for ex )( et the
variants (inter alia) on i 39, 93 and ac-
counting for the loss of nostri by the
abbreviation W and for the intrusion of
enim by assuming dittography from the
preceding -em. But the idest clause would
still be unsatisfactory and the comparison
which he finds between the view of the
Stoics and that of the early Romans to
shew that both arrived at the same con-
clusion would not be clearly expressed.

Bentley, followed by Dav. and others,
declared the clause id est...z'nsam'am to
be spurious. Bake bracketed the whole
passage id est...insaniunt, and the theory
of a double gloss has found many ad-
herents, among them Wes. Bai. Hei.
T.S. Ml. Schiche.

Nissen Or. and Mo. retained the whole
passage. Or. notes ‘haec etymologica
sunt, addita in eurn finem ut, cur iam
Romani antiqui diu ante Socratem rectum
nomen illi animi commotioni indidissent,
manifestius appareret.'

It seems best to suppose that the un-
convincing nature of Cicero’s argument
has led to the fabrication of glosses to
eke out his meaning, these glosses being
compiled from §§ 9 and 10.

Hei. notes that the Stoic tendency to
support argument by appeal to the popular
consciousness often leads to strained in-
terpretations. Of course Cic. did not find
in his Greek sources a ref. to the views
of the early Romans but he may have
adapted an argument drawn from the
views of the early Greeks.
