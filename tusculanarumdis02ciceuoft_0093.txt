XII. §26. ille: sc. Thyestes.

Tantalo prognatus... Bentley first saw
that these lines were verse, viz. trochaic
septenarii, and corrected the unmetrical
socero of MSS to socru referring for socrus
as masc. to Naeuius in Nonius and Accius
in Priscian p. 698. Cf. Nonius ²²3 ‘socrus
et masculino genere ueteres dici posse
uoluerunt. Naeuius Pelliee: desim socru
tuo, fratri patrueli meo?’ Priscian Ι
p. ²48 ed. Krehl. ‘uetustissimi tamen
communiter hic et haec socrus profere-
bant—“Accius in Atreo simul et Pisaea
praemia arrepta a socru possedit suo.'''
Kiih„ Hei„ Ml. and others accept the
reading socru; Kl., followed by Bai. and
T.S.‚ reads socro having found that form
as a dat. in an inscription (Muratori 5 32).

qui quondam: sc. Pelops, not Thy-
estes, cf. ii 27, 67 n.

Oenomao: ao are treated as one syllable
by synizesis.

raptis...nuptiis: Hei. T.S. and Hasper
refer raptis to the treachery by which
Pelops gained his victory; but the word
does not lend itself to this meaning nor
was the story of treachery the only or, as
it seems, the prevailing one with regard
to the contest. Cf. ii 27, 67 n. In Pau-
sanias v 17, 7 we read that on the front
of the chest of Cypselus Oenomaus was
represented pursuing Pelops who had
Hippodamia witlz him, each hero having
two horses and the horses of Pelops
having wings. And Frazer there notes
that ‘on a terra-cotta relief, which was
found at Velletri, Pelops and Hippodamia
are apparently represented in a chariot
drawn bywinged horses’ (O. Jahn, A 7τῆᾱο-
logisclze Azfia'tze‚ p. 6n. 7). It seems to
me that the idea of the artist in each case
with regard to the race was that Pelops
drove off with Hippodamia to take her

away if he could on the condition of being
slain by Oenomaus if overtaken. Pelops
not being overtaken gained H. raptis
nuptiis. The lines Tantalo prognatus...
nuptiis are referred by Vahlen (Ennianae
Poesr's Reliquiae, p. 187) to Ennius'
Thyestes (Fr. 357). Vahlen thinks with
Bentley that the words souis iste quidem
pronepos belong also to the poet, but
most editors give them to Cicero, and
they seem to lack the Ennian ring.
Ribbeck (Rom. T rag, p. 20) is pretty
certainly right in thinking that these lines
came soon after the lines ‘pol mihi for-
tuna...’ of 19, 44.

pronepos : the descent was Jove, Tanta-
lus,Pelops, Thyestes. Cf. Quintil. ix 3, 57.

Nolite hospites... Bentley first saw that
these three lines were bacchiac tetrameters‚
as also the line ‘quidnam est, obsecro?
quid te adiri abnutas?' which is seen from
Or. iii 41, 164 to have followed them.
The three lines in the text are from the
Thyestes of Ennius (Vahlen op. cit.. p. 1 86)
and spoken by Thyestes to the chorus
when he finds that he has eaten the flesh
of his children; the line from the de
Oratore was spoken in response by a
member of the Chorus. Ribbeck, Ro‘m.

istic: sc. manete. It is difficult to
decide between this and istinc sc. abite
or possibly dicite. Vahlen quotes Plaut.
Merc. 912 ‘atque istic sta ilico⁷3 Kl.
Eur. Ph. 896.

The line ‘tanta uis...haeret’ is in-
complete. Bentley inserted meo before
tanta; Lachmann (on Lucr. iii 880) stetis3
Sff. followed Kuh. uobis. Sff. objects to
meo that the adj. is not necessary since
contagio mea precedes. Ribbeck in his
first edition put in meo after haberet
making four creticffi but in the second
edition Frag, 1 p. 59, writes ‘sed fortasse
nullo opus est additamento, siquidem post
creticum dimetrum ditrochaeum posuit

poeta.' But there is no trochaic rhythni
in the line.
