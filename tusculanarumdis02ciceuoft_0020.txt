xiv INTRODUCTION

word λύπη, but it will be rooted out now that its cause is set forth. This
cause is nothing else than opinio et iudicium magni praesentis et urgentzlr
mali, ἓ 61.

(b) aegritudo is intensified where to the idea of a great present
evil is added the idea that it is our duty to be annoyed at what has
occurred, §g 62-74.

To this idea are due disgusting modes of displaying grief, tearing
the cheeks, plucking out the hair; to the same idea is due the blame
bestowed by others upon those who fail to display the expected measure
of grief, eg. the blame which Aeschines cast upon Demosthenes.

Owing to the same idea some, when in grief, rush to the desert 3 some
become dumb, others rabid, hence the legends of Niobe and Hecuba 3
others, like the nurse in Ennius, tell their sorrows to the desert air, ἓξ, 62,
63. And all act in these various ways because they think it is their duty
to grieve. That this is so is shown by the fact that, if those in mourning
forget their grief for a moment, they blame themselves for doing so and
purposely recall their grief, and if children, in time of mourning, do not
display the proper air of gloom their elders take measures to produce it
artificially. Notice, too, the word ‘decreuz'’ in the play of Terence, a
plain indication that grief is an evil voluntarily, and not inevitably,
incurred. This fact explains why people can abstain from grief where
the circumstances forbid it, e.g. where men are daily falling in numbers
on the battle-field. It also explains why those who witnessed the murder
of Pompey were able to make good their flight to Tyre before their grief
burst forth, §g 64-66. And just because grief is a voluntary matter
nothing is more effective in bringing about its abandonment than the
persuasion that it does no good. And, because grief is a voluntary
matter and they have found that it does no good, men, who have
suffered much, endure their woes with more patience, ἓ 67.

The voluntary character of annoyance is further shown by the fact that
though the greatest philosophers recognise that they are in a most evil
state, since they are insipientes, inasmuch as they have not yet attained
to perfect wisdom, they nevertheless do not lament because in their
case there is no idea that it is a matter of duty to lament. The greatest
philosophers, eg. Aristotle and Theophrastus, have admitted that there
was much that they did not know, ἐξ 68, 69.

Again where a man thinks it unmanly to mourn he proves able to
abstain from mourning, ᾖ 70 fin„ 71 init.

Even those who deny that any man would voluntarily give way to
grief, and maintain that it is unavoidable, admit that men go further
than is necessary in giving way to it, in other words they admit that a
portion of it is voluntarily incurred, ἓ 71 fin.
