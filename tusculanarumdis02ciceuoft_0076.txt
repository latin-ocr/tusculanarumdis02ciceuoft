Aiacem: i 41, 98 n.

Orestem: persecuted by the F uries for
slaying his mother Clytaemnestra who,
along with Aegisthus, had murdered his
father Agamemnon.

furere: present, because they appeared
upon the stage in plays then extant. Cf.

18, 4² n. on ‘uolt.'

duodecim tabulae: see the extract and
reff. under ii 21, 48 n. on ‘amicorum
propinquorumque custodiis.'

escit: an inchoative form=esse incipit
of the MSS, which is evidently due to an
explanatory gloss. That escit was rightly
restored by Bouhier is indicated by the
fact that Nonius, p. 443, quotes this
passage with essi! and MSS of de Inu.
ii 50, 148 quote this law with erit and
those of ad Herenn. i 13, 23 with existet
or existat. escit occurs in Lucr. i 619 and
in Gellius xx 1, 25; escunt in Leg. iii 3, 9
‘discordiae ciuium escunt’ and it is also
no doubt the true reading lower down in
the same section ‘ast quando consules.
nec escunt’ and in ii ²4 60⁴ cui auro
dentes iuncti escunt.' Festus has supa-
escz'tzsuperen't and Paulus from Festus
escit = erit and tabescit: oberit.

stu1titiam=insaniam, as maintained
in the preceding sections, and this: z'-n
sanos, abstract for concrete. Noniusp. 4543
quotes the passage thus‘ insaniam enim
censuerunt.. 'but msanz'anz. u'esamtat ua-
cantem would be intolerable and the
authority of Nonius is slight, cf. Muller’s
Nonius 112 p. 257. Ern. proposed ssul-
titz'am enim censuerunt, id est inconstan-
tiam sanitate nacantem, posse...

id est=e72go ctiam. These words are
often used not to express identity but to
add something necessary to the argument,
cf. i 31, 75 n.

mediocritatem officiorum=media of-
ficia, but the idea in media receives more

While the strict Stoic doctrine was
that only those actions that were done in
accordance with virtue as the outcome of
perfect intention (possible only to the
ideal wise man) were good—these being
κατορθώματα, recte facta—and that only
the direct opposites of these were evil—-
ὰμαρτήματα, peccata—-and that all things
except virtue and vice were matters of
indifference, ἀδιάφορα, res indffrentes,
virtue being an unchangeable condition
of the mind in accordance with right
reason, the Stoics were compelled as a
concession to the practical facts of life to
admit that whatever contributes to bodily
well-being must have a certain positive
value (ἀξία) and must be desirable (προηγ-
μένα, producta) in all cases in which no
higher good suffers in consequence, and
that whatever is opposed to bodily well-
being, when higher duties are not involved,
must have a negative value (ἀπαξία) and
consequently deserve to be avoided (ἀπο-
προηγμένα, rez'ecta); and that an action
might be done in accordance with reason
even though the perfect intention necessary
to make it a right action were lacking.
All actions which occupied this inter-
mediate position they called καθήκοντα
(appropriate actions), oſjicz'a (duties); and
as κατορθώματα, right actions, were some-
times termed καθήκοντα τέλεια these
intermediate actions were sometimes
termed καθήκοντα μέσα, media ffcia.
The stultus (i.e. the non-philosopher)
cannot have the perfect intention necessary
to the performance of right actions but
