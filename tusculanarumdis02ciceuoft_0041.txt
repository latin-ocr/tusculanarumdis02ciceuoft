INTRODUCTION xxxv

διαχύσεις ε’πιίρσεις τε καὶ πτώσεις ἐνόμιζεν εἶναι τὰ πάθη (Cf. op. cil. p. 337 M.
[367 K.]). This passage brings out clearly, as do many others in Galen,
the distinction between the rival views, Zeno holding that aegritudo was
an abnormal state of mind resulting from a recens opinio praesentis mali
while Chrysippus held that the aegritudo was the opinio itself. But as
not every opinio resulted in a perturbatio it was necessary for Chrysippus
to define more closely than had been done by Zeno the particular kind
of opinio which in his opinion constituted an aegritudo: he had in fact
to include as part of the definition of the opinio what according to Zeno
was a distinct condition to which the opinio gave rise. This Chrysippus
did by the addition of the words which appear in Cicero’s translation
(11, 253 cf. 31, 74) as ut in eo rectum uideatur esse angi. That this
addition is due to Chrysippus is plain both from its logical consistency
with Chrysippus’ general position (Zeno's doctrine accounting for the
same facts in another way) and from the testimony of Galen op. cit.
p. 370 M. [p. 398 K.] where Posidonius’ criticism of Chrysippus' view
iS quoted: εἰ γὰρ τὸ μέγεθος τῶν φαινομένων ἀγαθῶν ἢ κακῶν κινεῖ τὸ νομίζειν
καθῆκον καὶ κατὰ ἀξίαν εἶναι παρόντων αὐτῶν ἦ παραγινομένων μηδένα λόγον
προσίεσθαι περὶ τοῦ ἄλλως δεῖν ὑπὸ αὐτῶν κινεῖσθαι, τοὺς ἀνυπέρβλητα νομί-
ζοντες εἶναι τὰ περὶ αὐτοὺς τοῦτο ἔδει πάσχειν; ibid. p. 371 M. [p. 399 K.]
τὸ δὲ ὑπολαμβάνειν κατὰ αἶξίαν εἶναι τῶν συμβεβηκότων οὕτως κεκινῆσθαι
ὥστε ἀποτρέψεσθαι τὸν λόγον, μέγα δὲ πάθος ἐμφαίνειν, οὗ καλῶς ὑπολαμ-
βαίνειν ἐστι’; cf. also 31, 76 ‘Chrysippus autem caput esse censet in
consolando detrahere illam opinionem maerenti, sz· se officio fungi putet
iusto atque debito' (see HirzeL Untersuclzungen iii, 416 f.‚· von Arnim,
Stoic. Vett. Fragm. i, xxiii3 Heine, de fontibus T. D. 15). Yet Cicero in
31, 74 can speak of Zeno having made an addition to the definition of
aegritudo which contains the words ‘z'n qua opinione illud insit ut
aegritudinem susczffiere oporteat)

This halting between two opinions, or failure to perceive the radical
inconsistency between the two views, might be confidently set down to
Cicero's own carelessness, indifference or lack of acumen, were it not
that Chrysippus himself is chargeable with precisely the same fault:
Galen op. cit. p. 337 M. [p. 367 K.] ἐν μὲν δὴ τούτοις τοῖς ὅροις ὁρμὰς καὶ
δόξας καὶ κρίσεις ὑπάρχειν οἴεται τὰ πάθη, κατὰ δέ τινας τῶν ἐφεξῆς Ἐπικούρῳ
καὶ Ζήνωνι μᾶλλον ἢ τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ δόγμασιν ἀκόλουθα γράφει· τήν τε γὰρ
λύπην ὁριζόμενος μείωσιν εἶναι’ φησι ἐπὶ φευκτῷ δοκοῦντι ὑπάρχειν καὶ γὰρ
αἱ μειώσεις καὶ αἱ ἐπάρσεις καὶ αἱ συστολαὶ καὶ αἱ διαχύσεις, καὶ γὰρ τούτων
ε’νίοτε μέμνηται ὃ καὶ θαυμάζειν ἐπέρχεταί μοι τᾶνδρὸς ἐν ἐπαγγελίᾳ
λογικῆς τε ἅμα καὶ ἀκριβοῦς διδασκαλίας οὐκ ἀκριβοῦντος. This being SO it
seems somewhat dangerous to assume either that the inconsistencies of
statements in Cicero are due to a reliance upon different sources in
