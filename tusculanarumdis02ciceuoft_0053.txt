INTRODUCTION xlvii

he were here in any way dependent upon Posidonius. On the other
hand the particular use made of the comparison here suggests rather
a reminiscence than a reference, unless we assume a recurrence of the
illustration in some other work of Chrysippus than the περὶ παθῶν.

The historical examples and poetical quotations in this section are
about equally Latin and Greek and Cicero turns so naturally from one
to the other as to make it appear that Greek as well as Latin examples
and quotations are not copied from some original but drawn from his
own wide reading.

The remainder of the book from c. 27 to the end is devoted to a dis-
cussion of the remedies for perturbatio. On this head, as Cicero confesses
(5, 9), the Stoics had little to say, whereas the Peripatetics devoted much
attention to it. Cicero could therefore, if he relied upon a Stoic source,
do little more than expand brief hints. But, as in Book III, when it comes
to a question of consolatio, the practical outweighs the theoretical‚ and
he takes into account methods of cure for mental disorders which cannot
be reconciled with strictly Stoic principles. In doing so he had the
authority (and perhaps the example) of Chrysippus who both deprecated
the insistence upon philosophieal subtleties in the case of acute πιίθη
(29, 63) and laid stress upon the desirability and possibility of curing the
perturbationes no matter what philosophical principles were espoused
either by the patient or the practitioner. In this respect the standpoint
of 28, 60 f. and 31, 66 is the same as that of Chrysippus as quoted by
Origen (see p. xlv above). Where this eclectic standpoint is not assumed
Cicero is entirely in the matter of the curatio on the side of the Stoics
who assumed perturbatio to be purely a matter of opinion (δόξα), e.g. in
31, 655 34, 763 35, 743 37, 793 37, 815 38, 82 f· And the psychologieal
view implied in 35, 78 (see explanatory notes there) is emphatically that
of the older Stoica

There is nothing then in this book to induce us to assume that
Cicero had any other authority or source than either Chrysippus or some
Stoic who adopted the Chrysippean standpoint. As in the preceding
book the evidence does not seem to point to any more than a general
dependence upon this source except in the case of the list of definitions
in 7, 14 ff. where it is not unreasonable to assume that Cicero is copying
directly either from some handbook or, perhaps, from a list compiled for
his use.
