25 doctissimas uoces aures clausas fuisse? 3. quin etiam arbitror
propter Pythagoreorum admirationem Numam quoque regem
Pythagoreum a posterioribus existimatum. nam cum Pythagorae
disciplinam et instituta cognoscerent regisque eius aequitatem
et sapientiam a maioribus suis accepissent, aetates autem et
30 tempora ignorarent propter uetustatem, eum, qui sapientia ex-

celleret, Pythagorae auditorem crediderunt fuisse.

nv§sumam Pythagoreum : the theory

and Seeley, Livy i, Introd. p. 40, accounts
for its origin by the theory that, when
N uma’s intercourse with Egeria ceased to
be believed, some other explanation of
his wisdom was sought and hence arose

that Numa was either a pupil or at least
a follower of Pythagoras (Schwegler‚
Rom. Hist. 1 560-43 Plut. Q. Rom. 10) is
put forward in de R.P. ii 15, 28 and
refuted by a reference to chronology, in
which we find a translation of a reflexion of
Polybius (vi 59, 2) and in the immediately
preceding context Cicero has the words
‘sequamur enirn potissimum Polybium
nostrum, quo nemo fuit in exquirendis
temporibus diligentior.’ Hence Niebuhr,
HR. 1 238, rightly observes that ‘The
discourse on the early history of Rome
which Cicero puts in the mouth of Scipio
is entirely taken from Polybius.' Poly—
bius' criticism has been repeated by many
subsequent writers, e.g. Cic. de R.P.‚ l.c.;
Or. ii 37, ¹543 Livyi 18, 2; xl 29, 83
Dionys. Halic. ii 59, 1.

Rejecting the story, Mo. on de R.P.
l. c. traces the error to the following
causes: (a) one Pythagoras of Sparta was
victor in the Olympiad in which Numa
gained the throne3 (b) Pythagoras settled
in Italy, where Numa reigned; (c) there
seemed to be a parallel between the
wisdom and legislation of the two leaders 3

the theory of his being a pupil of Pytha-
goras, the only Gk philosopher who was
well-known to the Italians. See also
Momms. RH. 11 91.

instituta: Klotz in Add. p. 152 points
out that constituta cannot be defended by
such passages as Att. vi 1, ἰ ‘quod
quaedam a se constituta rescinderem,' and
ibid. ‘ cogitabam eius multa inique con-
stituta et acta tollere’ sor constituta is a
participle in those places. Klotz is pro-
bably right in thinking that the error is
due to an abbreviation istituta) (ostituta.

aetates...et tempora, ‘their periods
and dates.'

I Ι . uestigia.. rythagoreorum: the first
sure indication of knowledge of Pytha-
goras at Rome is found in the setting up
of statues to that philosopher and Alci-
biades in cornibus comitii at Rome by
order of the senate in obedience to the
Delphic oracle in the time of the Samnite
wars, cf. Pliny, N.H. xxxiv 12, 2-63
Plut. Numa 8; another is afforded by
the story os the Gk books said to have
been found in 181 Rc. on the Janiculum
in a box labelled as containing writings
