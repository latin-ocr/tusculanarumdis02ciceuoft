INTRODUCTJON xxix

of unhappiness. What about poverty? Epicurus is an adherent of the
simple life, and indeed a man who keeps far from him the passions
which money is required to gratify has no need of money. Anacharsis
the Scythian might be an example to Greek and Roman philosophers
in this respect 5 and all might imitate with advantage the contempt for
wealth that was displayed by Socrates, Xenocrates and DiogeneS, §388-92.

Epicurus' division of the desires into (a) those natural and necessary,
(b) those natural and unnecessary, (c) those neither natural nor necessary,
while not very scientific‚ is useful: for (a) the first class are satisfied
with next to nothing, (b) the second class are more or less a matter of
indifference, and (c) the third class should not be satisfied at all. On
these points the Epicureans point out that ex. gr. the passion of love,
which falls under the second class, can be gratified easily and easily done
without 3 and Epicurus’ doctrine of the wisdom of enduring pain in the
hope of securing greater future pleasure, and of the function of the mind
in deciding what pleasure is, makes it possible for the wise man to be
perpetually happy, at any rate with the help of recollection and antici-
pation‚ ἐξ 93-96.

This has its bearing upon the gratification of appetite ; hunger and
thirst make anything sweet 3 exercise produces a healthy appetite, the
gratification of which gives pleasure even though the food be coarse,
as we see in the case of the Spartans and Persians 3 simple fare and
abstinence ensure health‚ and consequently pleasure ; on the other hand
rich food and gluttony produce discomfort and disease, as the anecdotes
told of Timotheus and Plato show. A Sardanapallus was little better
than a brute, §g 97-101. Nor is wealth required for the satisfaction of
the artistic tastes‚ which are gratified not by possession of works of art
but by contemplation of thern, g 102.

Again obscurity or unpopularity need not cause unhappiness. Men
like Demosthenes or Democritus should be above the judgment of the
vulgar, as even a flute blower is in the practice of his profession.
A community often hates or neglects its most eminent citizen, as the
people of Ephesus and of Athens did in the cases of Hermodorus and
Aristides: a life of ease and contemplation is better than a public career
after all, ἐξ 103—105.

Many men fear exile, unreasonably; but its usual cause, unpopularity,
and its frequent concomitant, poverty, have been already shown to be of
no consequence, and merely to be absent from one’s country is not
a misfortune 3 many go abroad for gain, many philosophers to acquire
knowledge—if one is exiled for crime that is a different matter. A phil-
osopher is equally at home in every place where he is well off. Of this
history furnishes many examples, §g 106-109.
